determine kicking order As part trial reduce this advantage IFAB sanctioned in March test different sequence taking penalties known as ABBA that mirrors serving sequence in tennis tiebreak team kicks

Business Meeting in Glasgow Scotland on November it was agreed that due lack strong support mainly its complexity ABBA option would no longer be used in future competitions Alternatives edit Various tie break methods have been proposed both before since shoot outs were introduced Historically one first tie breaking procedures was contained in Sheffield Rules between with concept rouge scorable ball went narrowly wide off goal Rule stated goal outweighs any number rouges Should no goals an equal number be obtained match decided by rouges Similarly try in rugby football was used from as tie breaker if teams were level on goals drawn result may be allowed stand unless fixture determines which team qualifies later round Before except in FA Charity Shield was shared if match was drawn third place playoff Olympic tournament between Soviets East Germany ended after extra time bronze medal was shared by two teams During qualification process World Cup Morocco Tunisia formed two team group They both won at home so they played third match at neutral location this ended in draw after extra time Morocco advanced on coin toss next round qualification This scenario was repeated during qualification process World Cup same two teams were tied after three matches extra time Again Morocco advanced on coin toss Tunisia did have better luck with coin toss in intervening years during African Cup Nations they reached final at expense Senegal by winning coin toss after three group matches had left Tunisia Senegal tied with win over Ethiopia draw against each other Current alternatives include replaying match that has ended in draw This still occurs in fifth last sixteen round earlier rounds English FA Cup Until any number replays were permitted with record five failed verification Since then draw in first replay has been resolved by penalty shoot out Only once in did European Cup final go replay Other suggestions have included using elements match play such as most shots on goal most corner kicks awarded fewest cautions sendings off having ongoing extra time with teams compelled remove players at progressive intervals similar regular season play in National Hockey League players play on in extra time These proposals have not yet been authorised by International Football Association Board However after World Cup Sepp Blatter stated that he wants no more penalty shoot outs in Final World Cup tentatively suggesting either replay Maybe take players away play golden goal Henry Birtles Advantage proposal shoot out be held before extra time only acting as tiebreak if game remains draw after full minutes Proponents this idea state that it would lead more offensive extra time as one teams would know they have score would never be match in which both teams are simply waiting penalties Another advantage that players have missed would have chance redeem themselves in extra time obvious flaw that team that wins penalty shoot out would be inclined play defensively in extra time in knowledge that draw would put them through However this flaw not so clear single goal makes difference between winning losing as opposed team which defends single goal lead more comfortably conceded goal difference between winning drawing Another alternative Attacker Defender Goalkeeper ADG which features series ten contests in which an attacker has thirty seconds score goal against defender goalkeeper At completion ten contests team with most goals winner North American experiments edit North American Soccer League NASL in s s then Major League Soccer MLS its first four seasons experimented with variation shoot out procedure Instead straight penalty kick shoot out started yards m from goal having five seconds attempt shot player could make as many moves as he could in breakaway situation in five seconds then attempt shot This procedure similar that used in an ice hockey penalty shot As with standard shoot out this variation used best five kicks model if score was still level tiebreaker would head an extra round one attempt per team This format rewarded player skills as players were able attempt deceive goalkeepers play ball in an attempt make shot as in one on one skills contest goalkeepers could take on attackers without restrictions that are normally implemented in penalty shootouts Soccer Bowl NASL s championship final was decided by this format From its inception in NASL used an unconventional point system in determining league standings Teams were awarded six points win three points draw In addition teams earned one bonus point each goal scored in game up maximum three per game Thus team that lost would earn three points However team that lost would earn no points Also team that won would earn nine points same as win But team that won would earn only eight points In league s second season Kansas City Spurs were league champions with wins losses ties even though Atlanta Chiefs had wins losses ties Kansas City earned more bonus points Starting with postseason playoff matches NASL used golden goal rule every match had winner decided from run play Extra time sessions were minutes long before brief break change ends Game NASL semifinal series between Rochester Lancers Dallas Tornado went six extra time periods with Rochester scoring game winning goal in th minute Game that same series went four extra time periods with Dallas scoring in th minute win match series In NASL adopted conventional penalty kick shootout system all regular season postseason playoff matches were no longer any NASL matches that ended in ties In standings team that won in regulation time was awarded six points team that won in penalty kick shootout was awarded one point Bonus points continued be awarded each goal scored up maximum three per game In NASL adopted experimental North American shootout procedure described above If match was tied after minutes maximum two golden goal extra time periods minutes each were played If neither team scored shootout was held determine winner match In standings team that won was awarded six points whether win came in regulation time extra time by shootout Bonus points continued be awarded each goal scored up maximum three per game No bonus points were awarded goals scored in extra time Postseason playoff games were decided in same manner In number points awarded team that won game in shootout was reduced from six four This remained system until NASL s final season in From its inception in MLS used shootout system that had been used by NASL determine winners matches No regular season postseason playoff games ended in tie In general no extra time was played shootout commenced immediately after minutes had been played only exception was in MLS Cup Final in which match tied after minutes would be followed by maximum two minute extra time sessions on golden goal basis In regular season standings team that won match in regulation was awarded three points team that won match in shootout was awarded one point were no bonus points points awarded teams that lost whether in regulation time shootout In playoffs conference semifinals conference finals were organized as best three matches series shootout win counted as win Thus team could win two three matches by shootout lose other match in regulation still advance next round This was inconsistent with teams were rewarded during regular season team with one win would have earned three points team with two wins would have earned only two points In maximum two minute golden goal extra time periods were added matches that were tied after minutes regulation play If neither team scored during extra time match was decided by shootout MLS abandoned North American style shootout starting with season
