Short term memory Wikipedia Short term memory From Wikipedia free encyclopedia Jump navigation Jump search Process that deals with storage retrieval modification information received short time ago Not be confused with working memory Short term memory primary active memory capacity holding but not manipulating small amount information in mind in an active readily available state short period time example short term memory can be used remember phone number that has just been recited duration short term memory rehearsal active maintenance prevented believed be in order seconds most commonly cited capacity Magical Number Seven Plus Minus Two which frequently referred as Miller s Law despite facts that Miller himself stated that figure was intended as little more than joke Miller page that Cowan provided evidence that more realistic figure units In contrast long term memory can hold information indefinitely Short term memory should be distinguished from working memory which refers structures processes used temporarily storing manipulating information see details below Contents Existence separate store Evidence Anterograde amnesia Distraction tasks Models Unitary model Another explanation Biological basis Synaptic theory Relationship with working memory Duration Capacity Rehearsal Chunking Factors affecting Conditions Alzheimer s disease Aphasia Schizophrenia Advanced age Posttraumatic stress disorder Intelligence Measuring digit span short term memory Short term memory in literature popular culture See also References Notes Bibliography External links Existence separate store edit idea division memory into short term long term dates back th century classical model memory developed in s assumed that all memories pass from short term long term store after small period time This model referred as modal model has been most famously detailed by Shiffrin exact mechanisms by which this transfer takes place whether all only some memories are retained permanently indeed existence genuine distinction between two stores remain controversial topics among experts Evidence edit Anterograde amnesia edit One form evidence cited in favor separate existence short term store comes from anterograde amnesia inability learn new facts episodes Patients with this form amnesia have intact ability retain small amounts information over short time scales up seconds but are dramatically impaired in ability form longer term memories famous example patient HM This interpreted as showing that short term store spared from amnesia other brain diseases Distraction tasks edit Other evidence comes from experimental studies showing that some manipulations e g distractor task such as repeatedly subtracting single digit number from larger number following learning cf Brown Peterson procedure impair memory most recently learned words list it presumed still held in short term memory while leaving recall words from earlier in list it presumed stored in long term memory unaffected other manipulations e g semantic similarity words affect only memory earlier list words but do not affect memory last few words in list These results show that different factors affect short term recall disruption rehearsal long term recall semantic similarity Together these findings show that long term memory short term memory can vary independently each other Models edit Unitary model edit Not all researchers agree that short term long term memory are separate systems Some theorists propose that memory unitary clarification needed over all time scales from milliseconds years Support unitary memory hypothesis comes from fact that it has been difficult demarcate clear boundary between short term long term memory instance Tarnow shows that recall probability vs latency curve straight line from seconds ten minutes with probability failure recall only saturating after seconds If were really two different memory stores operating in this time frame one could expect discontinuity in this curve Other research has shown that detailed pattern recall errors looks remarkably similar recall list immediately after learning it presumed from short term memory recall after hours necessarily from long term memory Further evidence against existence short term memory store comes from experiments involving continual distractor tasks In Robert Bjork William B Whitten presented subjects with word pairs be remembered however before after each word pair subjects had do simple multiplication task seconds After final word pair subjects had do multiplication distractor task seconds In results Bjork Whitten found that recency effect increased probability recall last items studied primacy effect increased probability recall first few items still remained These results would seem inconsistent with idea short term memory as distractor items would have taken place some word pairs in buffer thereby weakening associated strength items in long term memory Bjork Whitten hypothesized that these results could be attributed memory processes at work long term memory retrieval versus short term memory retrieval Ovid J L Tzeng also found an instance recency effect in free recall did not seem result from function short term memory store Subjects were presented with four study test periods word lists with continual distractor task second period counting backward At end each list participants had free recall as many words from list as possible After free recall fourth list participants were asked free recall items from all four lists Both initial free recall final free recall showed recency effect These results went against predictions short term memory model no recency effect would be expected in either initial final free recall Koppenaal Glanzer attempted explain these phenomena as result subjects adaptation distractor task which therefore allowed them preserve at least some functions short term memory store As evidence they provided results experiment in which long term recency effect disappeared distractor after last item differed from distractors that preceded followed all other items e g arithmetic distractor task word reading distractor task Thapar Greene challenged this theory In one experiments participants were given different distractor task after every item be studied According Koppenaal s Glanzer s theory should be no recency effect as subjects would not have had time adapt distractor yet such recency effect remained in place in experiment Another explanation edit One proposed explanation existence recency effect in continual distractor condition disappearance it in an end only distractor task influence contextual distinctive processes According this model recency result final items processing context being similar processing context other items distinctive position final items versus items in middle list In end distractor task processing context final items no longer similar processing context other list items At same time retrieval cues these items are no longer as effective as without distractor Therefore recency effect recedes vanishes However distractor tasks are placed before after each item recency effect returns all list items once again have similar processing context Biological basis edit Synaptic theory edit Various researchers have proposed that stimuli are coded in short term memory using transmitter depletion According this hypothesis stimulus activates spatial pattern activity across neurons in brain region As these neurons fire available neurotransmitters in store are depleted this pattern depletion iconic representing stimulus information functions as memory trace memory trace decays over time as consequence neurotransmitter reuptake mechanisms that restore neurotransmitters levels that existed prior stimulus presentation Relationship with working memory edit relationship between short term memory working memory described differently by various theories but it generally acknowledged that two concepts are distinct Working memory theoretical framework that refers structures processes used temporarily storing manipulating information As such working memory might also be referred as working attention Working memory attention together play major role in processes thinking Short term memory in general refers in theory neutral manner short term storage information it does not entail manipulation organization material held in memory Thus while are short term memory components working memory models concept short term memory distinct from these more hypothetical concepts Within Baddeley s influential model working memory are two short term storage mechanisms phonological loop visuospatial sketchpad Most research referred here involves phonological loop most work done on short term memory has used verbal material Since s however has been surge in research on visual short term memory also increasing work on spatial short term memory Duration edit limited duration short term memory seconds without form memory rehearsal quickly suggests that its contents spontaneously decay over time citation needed decay assumption part many theories short term memory most notable one being Baddeley s model working memory decay assumption usually paired with idea rapid covert rehearsal In order overcome limitation short term memory retain information longer information must be periodically repeated rehearsed either by articulating it out loud by mentally simulating such articulation In this way information likely re enter short term store be retained further period Several researchers however dispute that spontaneous decay plays any significant role in forgetting over short term evidence far from conclusive Authors doubting that decay causes forgetting from short term memory often offer as an alternative some form interference several elements such as digits words pictures logos in general are held in short term memory simultaneously representations compete with each other recall degrade each other Thereby new content gradually pushes out older content unless older content actively protected against interference by rehearsal by directing attention it Capacity edit Whatever cause causes forgetting over short term may be consensus that it severely limits amount new information that we can retain over brief periods time This limit referred as finite capacity short term memory capacity short term memory often called memory span in reference common procedure measuring it In memory span test experimenter presents lists items e g digits words increasing length An individual s span determined as longest list length that he she can recall correctly in given order on at least half all trials In an early highly influential article Magical Number Seven Plus Minus Two psychologist George Miller suggested that human short term memory has forward memory span approximately seven items plus minus two that that was well known at time it seems go back th century researcher Wundt More recent research has shown that this magical number seven roughly accurate college students recalling lists digits but memory span varies widely with populations tested with material used example ability recall words in order depends on number characteristics these words fewer words can be recalled words have longer spoken duration this known as word length effect speech sounds are similar each other this called phonological similarity effect More words can be recalled words are highly familiar occur frequently in language Recall performance also better all words in list are taken from single semantic category such as games than words are taken from different categories more up date estimate short term memory capacity about four pieces chunks information However other prominent theories short term memory capacity argue against measuring capacity in terms fixed number elements Rehearsal edit Rehearsal process information kept in short term memory by mentally repeating it information repeated each time that information reentered into short term memory thus keeping that information another seconds average storage time short term memory Chunking edit Chunking process by which one can expand his her ability remember things in short term Chunking also process by which person organizes material into meaningful groups Although average person may retain only about four different units in short term memory chunking can greatly increase person s recall capacity example in recalling phone number person could chunk digits into three groups first area code such as then three digit chunk last four digit chunk This method remembering phone numbers far more effective than attempting remember string digits Practice usage existing information in long term memory can lead additional improvements in one s ability use chunking In one testing session an American cross country runner was able recall string digits after hearing them only once by chunking them into different running times e g first four numbers were three mile time Factors affecting edit It very difficult demonstrate exact capacity short term memory STM it will vary depending on nature material be recalled currently no way defining basic unit information be stored in STM store It also possible that STM not store described by Atkinson Shiffrin In that case task defining task STM becomes even more difficult However capacity STM can be affected by following Influence long term memory Reading aloud Pronunciation time Individual differences citation needed Diseases that cause neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer s disease can also be factor in person s short term eventually long term memory Damage certain sections which brain due this disease causes shrinkage in cerebral cortex which disables ability think recall memories Conditions edit Memory loss natural process in aging One study investigated whether not were deficits in short term memory in older adults This was previous study which compiled normative French data three short term memory tasks Verbal visual spatial They found impairments present in participants between ages years age Alzheimer s disease edit Memory distortion in Alzheimer s disease very common disorder found in older adults Performance patients with mild moderate Alzheimer s disease was compared with performance age matched healthy adults Researchers concluded study with findings that showed reduced short term memory recall Alzheimer s patients Episodic memory semantic abilities deteriorate early in Alzheimer s disease Since cognitive system includes interconnected reciprocally influenced neuronal networks one study hypothesized that stimulation lexical semantic abilities may benefit semantically structured episodic memory They found that with Lexical Semantic stimulation treatment may improve episodic memory in Alzheimer s Disease patients It could also be regarded as clinical option counteract cognitive decline typical disease Aphasia edit Aphasias are also seen in many elder adults Aphasias are responsible many sentence comprehension deficits full citation needed Many language impaired patients make several complaints about short term memory deficits with several family members confirming that patients have trouble recalling previously known names events opinion supported by many studies showing that many aphasics also have trouble with visual memory required tasks Schizophrenia edit Core symptoms schizophrenia patients have been linked cognitive deficits One neglected factor that contributes those deficits comprehension time In this study results confirm that cognitive dysfunctions are major deficit in patients with schizophrenia study provided evidence that patients with schizophrenia process temporal information inefficiently Advanced age edit Advanced age associated with decrements in episodic memory associative deficit in which age differences in recognition memory reflect difficulty in binding components memory episode bound units previous study used mixed blocked test designs examine deficits in short term memory older adults found was an associative deficit older adults This study along with many other previous studies continue build evidence deficits found in older adults short term memory Even neurological diseases disorders are not present progressive gradual loss some intellectual functions that become evident in later years are several tests used examine psychophysical characteristics elderly them well suitable test would be functional reach FR test mini mental state examination MMSE FR test an index aptitude maintain balance in an upright position MMSE test global index cognitive abilities These tests were both used by Costarella et al evaluate psychophysical characteristics older adults They found loss physical performance FR related height as well as loss cognitive abilities MMSE Posttraumatic stress disorder edit Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD associated with altered processing emotional material with strong attentional bias toward trauma related information interferes with cognitive processing Aside from trauma processing specificities wide range cognitive impairments have been related PTSD state with predominant attention verbal memory deficits Intelligence edit have been few studies done on relationship between short term memory intelligence in PTSD However examined whether people with PTSD had equivalent levels short term non verbal memory on Benton Visual Retention Test BVRT whether they had equivalent levels intelligence on Raven Standard Progressive Matrices RSPM They found that people with PTSD had worse short term non verbal memory on BVRT despite having comparable levels intelligence on RSPM concluding impairments in memory influence intelligence assessments in subjects Measuring digit span short term memory edit are many tests measure digit span short term visual memory some paper some computer based including following Digit Span Test by Cambridge Brain Sciences Digit Span Backwards Digit Span implemented in Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Memory Game implemented in Mental Attributes Profiling System Infant Memory Development implemented in Infant Cognition Lab UCDavis Infants were placed in front screen possessing different colored squares squares changed color in order catch infants attention If infants looked at screen longer duration scientists were able determine that participants noticed color shift effectively displaying ability identify that squares were same object just different in color researches concluded that children months age were only capable remembering one thing as children months were able remember several things These results suggested that within first year age short term memory develops very quickly Short term memory in literature popular culture edit
