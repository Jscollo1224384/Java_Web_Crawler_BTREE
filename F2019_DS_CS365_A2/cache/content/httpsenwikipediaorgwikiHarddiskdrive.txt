drive disk storage shipped in as component IBM RAMAC system It was approximately size two medium sized refrigerators stored five million six bit characters megabytes on stack disks In IBM was superseded by IBM disk storage unit which consisted platters each about inch thick inches in diameter While IBM used only two read write heads used an array heads one per platter moving as single unit Cylinder mode read write operations were supported heads flew about micro inches about m above platter surface Motion head array depended upon binary adder system hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning cabinet was about size three home refrigerators placed side by side storing equivalent about million eight bit bytes Access time was about quarter second Also in IBM introduced model disk drive which was about size washing machine stored two million characters on removable disk pack Users could buy additional packs interchange them as needed much like reels magnetic tape Later models removable pack drives from IBM others became norm in most computer installations reached capacities megabytes by early s Non removable HDDs were called fixed disk drives Some high performance HDDs were manufactured with one head per track e g Burroughs B in IBM in so that no time was lost physically moving heads track only latency was time desired block data rotate into position under head Known as fixed head head per track disk drives they were very expensive are no longer in production In IBM introduced new type HDD code named Winchester Its primary distinguishing feature was that disk heads were not withdrawn completely from stack disk platters drive was powered down Instead heads were allowed land on special area disk surface upon spin down taking off again disk was later powered on This greatly reduced cost head actuator mechanism but precluded removing just disks from drive as was done with disk packs day Instead first models Winchester technology drives featured removable disk module which included both disk pack head assembly leaving actuator motor in drive upon removal Later Winchester drives abandoned removable media concept returned non removable platters Like first removable pack drive first Winchester drives used platters inches mm in diameter few years later designers were exploring possibility that physically smaller platters might offer advantages Drives with non removable eight inch platters appeared then drives that used in mm form factor mounting width equivalent that used by contemporary floppy disk drives latter were primarily intended then fledgling personal computer PC market As s began HDDs were rare very expensive additional feature in PCs but by late s cost had been reduced point they were standard on all but cheapest computers Most HDDs in early s were sold PC end users as an external add on subsystem subsystem was not sold under drive manufacturer s name but under subsystem manufacturer s name such as Corvus Systems Tallgrass Technologies under PC system manufacturer s name such as Apple ProFile IBM PC XT in included an internal MB HDD soon thereafter internal HDDs proliferated on personal computers External HDDs remained popular much longer on Apple Macintosh Many Macintosh computers made between featured SCSI port on back making external expansion simple Older compact Macintosh computers did not have user accessible hard drive bays indeed Macintosh K Macintosh K Macintosh Plus did not feature hard drive bay at all so on those models external SCSI disks were only reasonable

Sequential changes in direction magnetization represent binary data bits data read from disk by detecting transitions in magnetization User data encoded using an encoding scheme such as run length limited encoding f which determines data represented by magnetic transitions typical HDD design consists spindle that holds flat circular disks called platters which hold recorded data platters are

performance servers first HDDs spun at rpm many years rpm was norm As November update platters in most consumer grade HDDs spin at RPM Information written read from platter as it rotates past devices called read write heads that are positioned operate very close magnetic surface with flying height often in range tens nanometers read write head used detect modify magnetization material passing immediately under it In modern drives one head each magnetic platter surface on spindle mounted on common arm An actuator arm access arm moves heads on an arc roughly radially across platters as they spin allowing each head access almost entire surface platter as it spins arm moved using voice coil actuator in some older designs stepper motor Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second resulting in all tracks having same amount data per track but modern drives since s use zone bit recording increasing write speed from inner outer zone thereby storing more data per track in outer zones In modern drives small size magnetic regions creates danger that magnetic state might be lost thermal effects thermally induced magnetic instability which commonly known as superparamagnetic limit counter this platters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers separated by three atom layer non magnetic element ruthenium two layers are magnetized in opposite orientation thus reinforcing each other Another technology used overcome thermal effects allow greater recording densities perpendicular recording first shipped in as used in certain HDDs In new concept was introduced allow further increase data density in magnetic recording use recording media consisting coupled soft hard magnetic layers So called exchange spring media magnetic storage technology also known as exchange coupled composite media allows good writability due write assist nature soft layer However thermal stability determined only by hardest layer not influenced by soft layer Components edit An HDD with disks motor hub removed exposing copper colored stator coils surrounding bearing in center spindle motor orange stripe along side arm thin printed circuit cable

have only one magnet voice coil itself shaped rather like an arrowhead made doubly coated copper magnet wire inner layer insulation outer thermoplastic which bonds coil together after it wound on form making it self supporting portions coil along two sides arrowhead which point center actuator bearing then interact with magnetic field fixed magnet Current flowing radially outward along one side arrowhead radially inward on other produces tangential force If magnetic field were uniform each side would generate opposing forces that would cancel each other out Therefore surface magnet half

radial forces that do not rotate head HDD s electronics control movement actuator rotation disk perform reads writes on demand from disk controller Feedback drive electronics accomplished by means special segments disk dedicated servo feedback These are either complete concentric circles in case dedicated servo technology segments interspersed with real data in case embedded servo technology servo feedback optimizes signal noise ratio GMR sensors by adjusting voice coil actuated arm spinning disk also uses servo motor Modern disk firmware capable scheduling reads writes efficiently on platter surfaces remapping sectors media which have failed Error rates handling edit Modern drives make extensive use error correction codes ECCs particularly Reed Solomon error correction These techniques store extra bits determined by mathematical formulas each block data extra bits allow many errors be corrected invisibly extra bits themselves take up space on HDD but allow higher recording densities be employed without causing uncorrectable errors resulting in much larger storage capacity example typical TB hard disk with byte sectors provides additional capacity about GB ECC data In newest drives as low density parity check codes LDPC were supplanting Reed Solomon LDPC codes enable performance close Shannon Limit thus provide highest storage density available Typical hard disk drives attempt remap data in physical sector that failing spare physical sector provided by drive s spare sector pool also called reserve pool while relying on ECC recover stored data while number errors in bad sector still low enough S M R T Self Monitoring Analysis Reporting Technology feature counts total number errors in entire HDD fixed by ECC although not on all hard drives as related S M R T attributes Hardware ECC Recovered Soft ECC Correction are not consistently supported total number performed sector remappings as occurrence many such errors may predict an HDD failure No ID Format developed by IBM in mid s contains information about which sectors are bad remapped sectors have been located Only tiny fraction detected errors end up as not correctable Examples specified uncorrected bit read error rates include specifications enterprise SAS disk drives state error rate be one uncorrected bit read error in every bits read specifications consumer SATA hard drives state error rate be one uncorrected bit read error in every bits Within given manufacturers model uncorrected bit error rate typically same regardless capacity drive worst type errors are silent data corruptions which are errors undetected by disk firmware host operating system some these errors may be caused by hard disk drive malfunctions while others originate elsewhere in connection between drive host Development edit Leading edge hard disk drive areal densities from through compared Moore s law rate areal density advancement was similar Moore s law doubling every two years through per year during during during Speaking in Gordon Moore called increase flabbergasting while observing later that growth cannot continue forever Price improvement decelerated per year during as growth areal density slowed rate advancement areal density slowed per year during was difficulty in migrating from perpendicular recording newer technologies As bit cell size decreases more data can be put onto single drive platter In production desktop TB HDD with four platters would have had an areal density about Gbit in which would have amounted bit cell comprising about magnetic grains by grains Since mid s areal density progress has increasingly been challenged by superparamagnetic trilemma involving grain size grain magnetic strength ability head write In order maintain acceptable signal noise smaller grains are required smaller grains may self reverse electrothermal instability unless magnetic strength increased but known write head materials are unable generate strong enough magnetic field sufficient write medium in increasingly smaller space taken by grains Several new magnetic storage technologies are being developed overcome at least abate this trilemma thereby maintain competitiveness HDDs with respect products such as flash memory based solid state drives SSDs In Seagate introduced shingled magnetic recording SMR intended as something stopgap technology between PMR Seagate s intended successor heat assisted magnetic recording HAMR SMR utilises overlapping tracks increased data density at cost design complexity lower data access speeds particularly write speeds random access k speeds By contrast competitor Western Digital focused on developing ways seal helium filled drives aim being reduce turbulence friction effects fit more

production desktop HDDs Seagate began sampling HAMR HDDs in They require different architecture with redesigned media read write heads new lasers new near field optical transducers Capacity edit Since June highest capacity desktop HDDs stored TB capacity hard disk drive as reported by an operating system end user smaller than amount stated by manufacturer several reasons operating system using some space use some space data redundancy space use file system structures Also difference in capacity reported in SI decimal prefixed units vs binary prefixes can lead false impression missing capacity Calculation edit Modern hard disk drives appear host controller as contiguous set logical blocks gross drive capacity calculated by multiplying number blocks by block size This information available from manufacturer s product specification from drive itself through use operating system functions that invoke low level drive commands gross capacity older HDDs calculated as product number cylinders per recording zone number bytes per sector most commonly count zones drive citation needed Some modern SATA drives also report cylinder head sector CHS capacities but these are not physical parameters reported values are constrained by historic operating system interfaces C H S scheme has been replaced by logical block addressing LBA simple linear addressing scheme that locates blocks by an integer index which starts at LBA first block increments thereafter using C H S method describe modern large drives number heads often set although typical hard disk drive as update has between one four platters In modern HDDs spare capacity defect management not included in published capacity however in many early HDDs certain number sectors were reserved as spares thereby reducing capacity available operating system RAID subsystems data integrity fault tolerance requirements also reduce realized capacity example RAID array has about half total capacity as result data mirroring while RAID array with x drives loses x capacity which equals capacity single drive due storing parity information RAID subsystems are multiple drives that appear be one drive more drives user but provide fault tolerance Most RAID vendors use checksums improve data integrity at block level Some vendors design systems using HDDs with sectors bytes contain bytes user data eight checksum bytes by using separate byte sectors checksum data Some systems may use hidden partitions system recovery reducing capacity available end user Formatting edit Main article Disk formatting Data stored on hard drive in series logical blocks Each block delimited by markers identifying its start end error detecting correcting information space between blocks allow minor timing variations These blocks often contained bytes usable data but other sizes have been used As drive density increased an initiative known as Advanced Format extended block size bytes usable data with resulting significant reduction in amount disk space used block headers error checking data spacing process initializing these logical blocks on physical disk platters called low level formatting which usually performed at factory not normally changed in field High level formatting writes data structures used by operating system organize data files on disk This includes writing partition file system structures into selected logical blocks example some disk space will be used hold directory disk file names list logical blocks associated with particular file Examples partition mapping scheme include Master boot record MBR GUID Partition Table GPT Examples data structures stored on disk retrieve files include File Allocation Table FAT in DOS file system inodes in many UNIX file systems as well as other operating system data structures also known as metadata As consequence not all space on an HDD available user files but this system overhead usually small compared with user data Units edit See also Binary prefix disk

mm MB HDD compared an older inch full height MB HDD IBM s first hard disk drive IBM used stack fifty inch platters stored MB data approximately size one modern digital picture was size comparable two large refrigerators In IBM introduced its model disk which used six inch nominal size platters in removable pack was roughly size washing machine This became standard platter size many years used also by other manufacturers IBM used platters same size in an eleven high pack introduced drive in drawer layout sometimes called pizza oven although drawer was not complete drive Into s HDDs were offered in standalone cabinets varying dimensions containing from one four HDDs Beginning in late s drives were offered that fit entirely into chassis that would mount in inch rack Digital s RK RL were early examples using single inch platters in removable packs entire drive fitting in inch high rack space six rack units In mid late s similarly sized Fujitsu Eagle which used coincidentally inch platters

initially followed those inch inch inch floppy disk drives Although referred by these nominal sizes actual sizes those three drives respectively are wide were no smaller floppy disk drives smaller HDD form factors developed from product offerings industry standards inch drives are actually wide As update inch inch hard disks are most popular sizes By all manufacturers had discontinued development new products inch inch inch form factors due falling prices flash memory which has no moving parts While nominal sizes are in inches actual dimensions are specified in millimeters Performance characteristics edit Main article Hard disk drive performance characteristics factors that limit time access data on an HDD are mostly related mechanical nature rotating disks moving heads including Seek time measure long it takes head assembly travel track disk that contains data Rotational latency incurred desired disk sector may not be directly under head data transfer requested Average rotational latency shown in table based on statistical relation that average latency one half rotational period bit rate data transfer rate once head in right position creates delay which function number blocks transferred typically relatively small but can be quite long with transfer large contiguous files Delay may also occur if drive disks are stopped save energy Defragmentation procedure used minimize delay in retrieving data by moving related items physically proximate areas on disk Some computer operating systems perform defragmentation automatically Although automatic defragmentation intended reduce access delays performance will be temporarily reduced while procedure in progress Time access data can be improved by increasing rotational speed thus reducing latency by reducing time spent seeking Increasing areal density increases throughput by increasing data rate by increasing amount data under set heads thereby potentially reducing seek activity given amount data time access data has not kept up with throughput increases which themselves have not kept up with growth in bit density storage capacity Latency edit Rotational speed rpm Average rotational latency ms Data transfer rate edit As update typical rpm desktop HDD has sustained disk buffer data transfer rate up Mbit s This rate depends on track location rate higher data on outer tracks are more data sectors per rotation lower toward inner tracks are fewer data sectors per rotation generally somewhat higher rpm drives current widely used standard buffer computer interface Gbit s SATA which can send about megabyte s bit encoding from buffer computer thus still comfortably ahead today s disk buffer transfer rates Data transfer rate read write can be measured by writing large file disk using special file generator tools then reading back file Transfer rate can be influenced by file system fragmentation layout files HDD data transfer rate depends upon rotational speed platters data recording density heat vibration limit rotational speed advancing density becomes main method improve sequential transfer rates Higher speeds require more powerful spindle motor which creates more heat While areal density advances by increasing both number tracks across disk number sectors per track only latter increases data transfer rate given rpm Since data transfer rate performance tracks only one two components areal density its performance improves at lower rate Other considerations edit Other performance considerations include quality adjusted price power consumption audible noise both operating non operating shock resistance Federal Reserve Board has quality adjusted price index large scale enterprise storage systems including three more enterprise HDDs associated

that used Parallel ATA interface inch SATA drive on top inch SATA drive showing close up pin data pin power connectors Current hard drives connect computer over one several bus types including parallel ATA Serial ATA SCSI Serial Attached SCSI SAS Fibre Channel Some drives especially external portable drives use IEEE USB All these interfaces are digital electronics on drive process analog signals from read write heads Current drives present consistent interface rest computer independent data encoding scheme used internally independent physical number disks heads within drive Typically DSP in electronics inside drive takes raw analog voltages from read head uses PRML Reed Solomon error correction decode data then sends that data out standard interface That DSP also watches error rate detected by error detection correction performs bad sector remapping data collection Self Monitoring Analysis Reporting Technology other internal tasks Modern interfaces connect drive host interface with single data control cable Each drive also has an additional power cable usually direct power supply unit Older interfaces had separate cables data signals drive control signals Small Computer System Interface SCSI originally named SASI Shugart Associates System Interface was standard on servers workstations Commodore Amiga Atari ST Apple Macintosh computers through mid s by which time most models had been transitioned IDE later SATA family disks length limit data cable allows external SCSI devices Integrated Drive Electronics IDE later standardized under name AT Attachment ATA with alias PATA Parallel ATA retroactively added upon introduction SATA moved HDD controller from interface card disk drive This helped standardize host controller interface reduce programming complexity in host device driver reduced system cost complexity pin IDE ATA connection transfers bits data at time on data cable data cable was originally conductor but later higher speed requirements led an ultra DMA UDMA mode using an conductor cable with additional wires reduce cross talk at high speed EIDE was an unofficial update by Western Digital original IDE standard with key improvement being use direct memory access DMA transfer data between disk computer without involvement CPU an improvement later adopted by official ATA standards By directly transferring data between memory disk DMA eliminates need CPU copy byte per byte therefore allowing it process other tasks while data transfer occurs Fibre Channel FC successor parallel SCSI interface on enterprise market It serial protocol In disk drives usually Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop FC AL connection topology used FC has much broader usage than mere disk interfaces it cornerstone storage area networks SANs Recently other protocols this field like iSCSI ATA over Ethernet have been developed as well Confusingly drives usually use copper twisted pair cables Fibre Channel not fibre optics latter are traditionally reserved larger devices such as servers disk array controllers Serial Attached SCSI SAS SAS new generation serial communication protocol devices designed allow much higher speed data transfers compatible with SATA SAS uses mechanically identical data power connector standard inch SATA SATA HDDs many server oriented SAS RAID controllers are also capable addressing SATA HDDs SAS uses serial

controllers with limited compatibility However they cannot be connected other way round SATA controller cannot be connected SAS drive Integrity failure edit Close up an HDD head resting on disk platter its mirror reflection visible on platter surface Main articles Hard disk drive failure Data recovery See also Solid state drive SSD reliability failure modes Due extremely close spacing between heads disk surface HDDs are vulnerable being damaged by head crash failure disk in which head scrapes across platter surface often grinding away thin magnetic film causing data loss Head crashes can be caused by electronic failure sudden power failure physical shock contamination drive s internal enclosure wear tear corrosion poorly manufactured platters heads HDD s spindle system relies on air density inside disk enclosure support heads at proper flying height while disk rotates HDDs require certain range air densities operate properly connection external environment density occurs through small hole in enclosure about mm in breadth usually with filter on inside breather filter If air density low then not enough lift flying head so head gets close disk risk head crashes

crash from contamination that does not remove magnetic surface disk still results in head temporarily overheating due friction with disk surface can render data unreadable short period until head temperature stabilizes so called thermal asperity problem which can partially be dealt with by proper electronic filtering read signal logic board hard disk fails drive can often be restored functioning order data recovered by replacing circuit board with one an identical hard disk In case read write head faults they can be replaced using specialized tools in dust free environment If disk platters are undamaged they can be transferred into an identical enclosure data can be copied cloned onto new drive In event disk platter failures disassembly imaging disk platters may be required logical damage file systems variety tools including fsck on UNIX like systems CHKDSK on Windows can be used data recovery Recovery from logical damage can require file carving common expectation that hard disk drives designed marketed server use will fail less frequently than consumer grade drives usually used in desktop computers However two independent studies by Carnegie Mellon University Google found that grade drive does not relate drive s failure rate summary research into SSD magnetic disk failure patterns by Tom s Hardware summarized research findings as follows Mean time between
