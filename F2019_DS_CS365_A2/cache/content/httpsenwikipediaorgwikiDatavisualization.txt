Big data Database Chartjunk Visual perception Regression analysis Statistical model Misleading graph v t e Data visualization graphic representation data It involves producing images that communicate relationships among represented data viewers images This communication achieved through use systematic mapping between graphic marks data values in creation visualization This mapping establishes data values will be represented visually determining extent property graphic mark such as size color will change reflect change in value datum communicate information clearly efficiently data visualization uses statistical graphics plots information graphics other tools Numerical data may be encoded using dots lines bars visually communicate quantitative message Effective visualization helps users analyze reason about data evidence It makes complex data more accessible understandable usable Users may have particular analytical tasks such as making comparisons understanding causality design principle graphic i e showing comparisons showing causality follows task Tables are generally used users will look up specific measurement while charts various types are used show patterns relationships in data one more variables Data visualization both an art science It viewed as branch descriptive statistics by some but also as grounded theory development tool by others Increased amounts data created by Internet activity an expanding number sensors in environment are referred as big data Internet things Processing analyzing communicating this data present ethical analytical challenges data visualization field data science practitioners called data scientists help address this challenge Contents Overview Characteristics effective graphical displays Quantitative messages

architecture Objectives Scope Related fields See also Notes References Further reading External links Overview edit Data visualization one steps in analyzing data presenting it users Data visualization refers techniques used communicate data information by encoding it as visual objects e g points lines bars contained in graphics goal communicate information clearly efficiently users It one steps in data analysis data science According Friedman main goal data visualization communicate information clearly effectively through graphical means It doesn t mean that data visualization needs look boring be functional extremely sophisticated look beautiful convey ideas effectively both aesthetic form functionality need go hand in hand providing insights into rather sparse complex data set by communicating its key aspects in more intuitive way Yet designers often fail achieve balance between form function creating gorgeous data visualizations which fail serve main purpose communicate information Indeed Fernanda Viegas Martin M Wattenberg suggested that an ideal visualization should not only communicate clearly but stimulate viewer engagement attention Data visualization closely related information graphics information visualization scientific visualization exploratory data analysis statistical graphics In new millennium data visualization has become an active area research teaching development According Post et al it has united scientific information visualization Characteristics effective graphical displays edit Charles Joseph Minard s diagram Napoleonic France s invasion Russia an early example an information graphic greatest value picture it forces us notice we never expected see John Tukey Professor Edward Tufte explained that users information displays are executing particular analytical tasks such as making comparisons design principle information graphic should support analytical task As William Cleveland Robert McGill show different graphical elements accomplish this more less effectively example dot plots bar charts outperform pie charts In his book Visual Display Quantitative Information Edward Tufte defines graphical displays principles effective graphical display in following passage Excellence in statistical graphics consists complex ideas communicated with clarity precision efficiency Graphical displays should show data induce viewer think about substance rather than about methodology graphic design technology graphic production something else avoid distorting data has say present many numbers in small space make large data sets coherent encourage eye compare different pieces data reveal data at several levels detail from broad overview fine structure serve reasonably clear purpose description exploration tabulation decoration be closely integrated with statistical verbal descriptions data set Graphics reveal data Indeed graphics can be more precise revealing than conventional statistical computations example Minard diagram shows losses suffered by Napoleon s army in period Six variables are plotted size army its location on two dimensional surface x y time direction movement temperature line width illustrates comparison size army at points in time while temperature axis suggests cause change in army size This multivariate display on two dimensional surface tells story that can be grasped immediately while identifying source data build credibility Tufte wrote in that It may well be best statistical graphic ever drawn Not applying these principles may result in misleading graphs which distort message support an erroneous conclusion According Tufte chartjunk refers extraneous interior decoration graphic that does not enhance message gratuitous three dimensional perspective effects Needlessly separating explanatory key from image itself requiring eye travel back forth from image key form administrative debris ratio data ink should be maximized erasing non data ink feasible Congressional Budget Office summarized several best practices graphical displays in June presentation These included Knowing audience b Designing graphics that can stand alone outside context report c Designing graphics that communicate key messages in report Quantitative messages edit time series illustrated with line chart demonstrating trends in U S federal spending revenue over time scatterplot illustrating negative correlation between two variables inflation unemployment measured at points in time Author Stephen Few described eight types quantitative messages that users may attempt understand communicate from set data associated graphs used help communicate message Time series single variable captured over period time such as unemployment rate over year period line chart may be used demonstrate trend Ranking Categorical subdivisions are ranked in ascending descending order such as ranking sales performance measure by sales persons category with each sales person categorical subdivision during single period bar chart may be used show comparison across sales persons Part whole Categorical subdivisions are measured as ratio whole i e percentage out pie chart bar chart can show comparison ratios such as market share represented by competitors in market Deviation Categorical subdivisions are compared against reference such as comparison actual vs budget expenses several departments business given time period bar chart can show comparison actual versus reference amount Frequency distribution Shows number observations particular variable given interval such as number years in which stock market return between intervals such as etc histogram type bar chart may be used this analysis boxplot helps visualize key statistics about distribution such as median quartiles outliers etc Correlation Comparison between observations represented by two variables X Y determine if they tend move in same opposite directions example plotting unemployment X inflation Y sample months scatter plot typically used this message Nominal comparison Comparing categorical subdivisions in no particular order such as sales volume by product code bar chart may be used this comparison Geographic geospatial Comparison variable across map layout such as unemployment rate by state number persons on various floors building cartogram typical graphic used Analysts reviewing set data may consider whether some all messages graphic types above are applicable task audience process trial error identify meaningful relationships messages in data part exploratory data analysis Visual perception data visualization edit human can distinguish differences in line length shape orientation color hue readily without significant processing effort these are referred as pre attentive attributes example it may require significant time effort attentive processing identify number times digit appears in series numbers but if that digit different in size orientation color instances digit can be noted quickly through pre attentive processing Effective graphics take advantage pre attentive processing attributes relative strength these attributes example since humans can more easily process differences in line length than surface area it may be more effective use bar chart which takes advantage line length show comparison rather than pie charts which use surface area show comparison Human perception cognition data visualization edit Almost all data visualizations are created human consumption Knowledge human perception cognition necessary designing intuitive visualizations Cognition refers processes in human beings like perception attention learning memory thought concept formation reading problem solving Human visual processing efficient in detecting changes making comparisons between quantities sizes shapes variations in lightness properties symbolic data are mapped visual properties humans can browse through large amounts data efficiently It estimated that brain s neurons can be involved in visual processing Proper visualization provides different approach show potential connections relationships etc which are not as obvious in non visualized quantitative data Visualization can become means data exploration History data visualization edit no comprehensive history data visualization are no accounts that span entire development visual thinking visual representation data which collate contributions disparate disciplines Michael Friendly Daniel J Denis York University are engaged in project that attempts provide comprehensive history visualization Contrary general belief data visualization not modern development Stellar data information such as location stars were visualized on walls caves such as those found in Lascaux Cave in Southern France since Pleistocene era Physical artefacts such as Mesopotamian clay tokens BC Inca quipus BC Marshall Islands stick charts n d can also be considered as visualizing quantitative information First documented data visualization can be tracked back B C with Turin Papyrus Map which accurately illustrates distribution geological resources provides information about quarrying those resources Such maps can be categorized as Thematic Cartography which type data visualization that presents communicates specific data information through geographical illustration designed show particular theme connected with specific geographic area Earliest documented forms data visualization were various thematic maps from different cultures ideograms hieroglyphs that provided allowed interpretation information illustrated example Linear B tablets Mycenae provided visualization information regarding Late Bronze Age era trades in Mediterranean idea coordinates was used by ancient Egyptian surveyors in laying out towns earthly heavenly positions were located by something akin latitude longitude at least by BC map projection spherical earth into latitude longitude by Claudius Ptolemy c c in Alexandria would serve as reference standards until th century Invention paper parchment allowed further development visualizations throughout history Figure shows graph from th possibly th century that intended be an illustration planetary movement used in an appendix textbook in monastery schools graph apparently was meant represent plot inclinations planetary orbits as function time this purpose zone zodiac was represented on plane with horizontal line divided into thirty parts as time longitudinal axis vertical axis designates width zodiac horizontal scale appears have been chosen each planet individually periods cannot be reconciled accompanying text refers only amplitudes curves are apparently not related in time Planetary Movements By th century techniques instruments precise observation measurement physical quantities geographic celestial position were well developed example wall quadrant constructed by Tycho Brahe covering an entire wall in his observatory Particularly important were development triangulation other methods determine mapping locations accurately French philosopher mathematician Ren Descartes Pierre de Fermat developed analytic geometry two dimensional coordinate system which heavily influenced practical methods displaying calculating values Fermat Blaise Pascal s work on statistics probability theory laid groundwork we now conceptualize as data According Interaction Design Foundation these developments allowed helped William Playfair saw potential graphical communication quantitative data generate develop graphical methods statistics Playfair TimeSeries In second half th century Jacques Bertin used quantitative graphs represent information intuitively clearly accurately efficiently John Tukey Edward Tufte pushed bounds data visualization Tukey with his new statistical approach exploratory data analysis Tufte with his book Visual Display Quantitative Information paved way refining data visualization techniques more than statisticians With progression technology came progression data visualization starting with hand drawn visualizations evolving into more technical applications including interactive designs leading software visualization Programs like SAS SOFA R Minitab Cornerstone more allow data visualization in field statistics Other data visualization applications more focused unique individuals programming languages such as D Python JavaScript help make visualization quantitative data possibility Private schools have also developed programs meet demand learning data visualization associated programming libraries including free programs like Data Incubator paid programs like General Assembly Beginning with Symposium Data Discovery in ArtCenter College Design Caltech JPL in Pasadena have run an annual program on Interactive Data Visualization program asks can interactive data visualization help scientists engineers explore data more effectively can computing design design thinking help maximize research results methodologies are most effective leveraging knowledge from these fields By encoding relational information with appropriate visual interactive characteristics help interrogate ultimately gain new insight into data program develops new interdisciplinary approaches complex science problems leveraging design thinking latest methods from computing User Centered Design interaction design D graphics Terminology edit Data visualization involves specific terminology some which derived from statistics example author Stephen Few defines two types data which are used in combination support meaningful analysis visualization Categorical Text labels describing nature data such as Name Age This term also covers qualitative non numerical data Quantitative Numerical measures such as represent age in years Two primary types information displays are tables graphs table contains quantitative data organized into rows columns with categorical labels It primarily used look up specific values In example above table might have categorical column labels representing name qualitative variable age quantitative variable with each row data representing one person sampled experimental unit category subdivision graph primarily used show relationships among data portrays values encoded as visual objects e g lines bars points Numerical values are displayed within an area delineated by one more axes These axes provide scales quantitative categorical used label assign values visual objects Many graphs are also referred as charts Eppler Lengler have developed Periodic Table Visualization Methods an interactive chart displaying various data visualization methods It includes six types data visualization methods data information concept strategy metaphor compound Examples diagrams used data visualization edit See also Diagram Name Visual Dimensions Example Usages
