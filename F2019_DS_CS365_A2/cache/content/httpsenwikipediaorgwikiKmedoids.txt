k medoids Wikipedia k medoids From Wikipedia free encyclopedia Jump navigation Jump search clustering algorithm minimizing sum distances k representatives k medoids partitioning around medoids PAM algorithm clustering algorithm reminiscent k means algorithm Both k means k medoids algorithms are partitional breaking dataset up into groups both attempt minimize distance between points labeled be in cluster point designated as center that cluster In contrast k means algorithm k medoids chooses data points as centers medoids exemplars can be used with arbitrary distances while in k means centre cluster not necessarily one input data points it average between points in cluster PAM method was proposed in work with l displaystyle l norm other distances k medoid classical partitioning technique clustering which clusters data set n objects into k clusters with number k clusters assumed known priori which implies that programmer must specify k before execution algorithm goodness given value k can be assessed with methods such as silhouette method It more robust noise outliers as compared k means it minimizes sum pairwise dissimilarities instead sum squared Euclidean distances medoid can be defined as object cluster whose average dissimilarity all objects in cluster minimal that it most centrally located point in cluster Algorithms edit PAM choosing initial medoids then iterating convergence k clusters visualized with ELKI most common realisation k medoid clustering partitioning around medoids PAM algorithm PAM uses greedy search which may not find optimum solution but it faster than exhaustive search It works as follows Initialize greedily select k n data points as medoids minimize cost Associate each data point closest medoid While cost configuration decreases each medoid m each non medoid data point o Consider swap m o compute cost change If cost change current best remember this m o combination Perform best swap m best displaystyle m text best o best displaystyle o text best if it decreases cost function Otherwise algorithm terminates runtime complexity original PAM algorithm per iteration O k n k displaystyle O k n k by only computing change in cost naive implementation recomputing entire cost function every time will be in O n k displaystyle O n k This runtime can be further reduced O n displaystyle O n by splitting cost change into three parts such that computations can be shared avoided Algorithms other than PAM have also been suggested in literature including following Voronoi iteration method Select initial medoids randomly Iterate while cost decreases In each cluster make point that minimizes sum distances within cluster medoid Reassign each point cluster defined by closest medoid determined in previous step However k means style Voronoi iteration finds worse results as it does not allow reassigning points other clusters while changing means thus only explores smaller search space approximate algorithms CLARA CLARANS trade optimality runtime CLARA applies PAM on multiple subsamples keeping best result CLARANS works on entire data set but only explores subset possible swaps medoids non medoids using sampling Software edit ELKI includes several k medoid variants including Voronoi iteration k medoids original PAM algorithm Reynolds improvements O n FastPAM algorithm CLARA CLARANS FastCLARA FastCLARANS Julia

matrix distance measures as well as number native integrated third party k means implementations R includes variants k means in flexclust package PAM implemented in cluster package including some FastPAM improvements via pamonce option RapidMiner has an operator named KMedoids but it does not implement KMedoids algorithm correctly Instead it k means variant that substitutes mean with closest data point which not medoid MATLAB implements PAM CLARA two other algorithms solve k medoid clustering problem References edit Kaufman L Rousseeuw P J Clustering by means Medoids in Statistical Data
