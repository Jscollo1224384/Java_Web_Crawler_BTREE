heatsinks if they do not receive sufficient cooling arflow will typically thermally throttle down after roughly minutes continuous operation at full speed Enterprise flash drives edit Top bottom views inch GB SATA Gbit s model Intel DC S series Enterprise flash drives EFDs are designed applications requiring high O performance IOPS reliability energy efficiency more recently consistent performance In most cases an EFD an SSD with higher set specifications compared with SSDs that would typically be used in notebook computers term was first used by EMC in January help them identify SSD manufacturers would provide products meeting these higher standards are no standards bodies control definition EFDs so any SSD manufacturer may claim produce EFDs in fact product may not actually meet any particular requirements An example Intel DC S series drives introduced in fourth quarter which focuses on achieving consistent performance an area that had previously not received much attention but which Intel claimed was important enterprise market In particular Intel claims that at steady state S drives would not vary IOPS by more than that all KB random Os are serviced in less than s

edit In first products with D Xpoint memory were released under Intel s Optane brand D Xpoint entirely different from NAND flash stores data using different principles Architecture function edit key components an SSD are controller memory store data primary memory component in an SSD was traditionally DRAM volatile memory but since it more commonly NAND flash non volatile memory Controller edit Every SSD includes controller that incorporates electronics that bridge NAND memory components host computer controller an embedded processor that executes firmware level code one most important factors SSD performance Some functions performed by controller include Bad block mapping Read write caching Encryption Crypto shredding Error detection correction via error correcting code ECC Garbage collection Read scrubbing read disturb management Wear leveling performance an SSD can scale with number parallel NAND flash chips used in device single NAND chip relatively slow due narrow bit asynchronous O interface additional high latency basic O operations typical SLC NAND s fetch KB page from array O buffer on read s commit KB page from IO buffer array on write ms erase KB block multiple NAND devices operate in parallel inside an SSD bandwidth scales high latencies can be hidden as long as enough outstanding operations are pending load evenly distributed between devices Micron Intel initially made faster SSDs by implementing data striping similar RAID interleaving in architecture This enabled creation ultra fast SSDs with MB s effective read write speeds with SATA Gbit s interface in Two years later SandForce continued leverage this parallel flash connectivity releasing consumer grade SATA Gbit s SSD controllers which supported MB s read write speeds SandForce controllers compress data before sending it flash memory This process may result in less writing higher logical throughput depending on compressibility data Wear leveling edit Main articles Wear leveling Write amplification If particular block programmed erased repeatedly without writing any other blocks that block will wear out before all other blocks thereby prematurely ending life SSD this reason SSD controllers use technique called wear leveling distribute writes as evenly as possible across all flash blocks in SSD In perfect scenario this would enable every block be written its maximum life so they all fail at same time Unfortunately process evenly distribute writes requires data previously written not changing cold data be moved so that data which are changing more frequently hot data can be written into those blocks Each time data are relocated without being changed by host system this increases write amplification thus reduces life flash memory key find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both Memory edit Flash memory based edit Comparison architectures Comparison characteristics MLC SLC NAND NOR Persistence ratio Sequential write ratio Sequential read ratio Price ratio Most SSD manufacturers use non volatile NAND flash memory in construction SSDs lower cost compared with DRAM ability retain data without constant power supply ensuring data persistence through sudden power outages Flash memory SSDs were initially slower than DRAM solutions some early designs were even slower than HDDs after continued use This problem was resolved by controllers that came out in later Flash based SSDs store data in metal oxide semiconductor MOS integrated circuit chips which contain non volatile floating gate memory cells Flash memory based solutions are typically packaged in standard disk drive form factors inch but also in smaller more compact form factors such as M form factor made possible by small size flash memory Lower priced drives usually use triple level cell TLC multi level cell MLC flash memory which slower less reliable than single level cell SLC flash memory This can be mitigated even reversed by internal design structure SSD such as interleaving changes writing algorithms higher over provisioning more excess capacity with which wear leveling algorithms can work DRAM based edit See also RAM Hyperdrive storage SSDs based on volatile memory such as DRAM are characterized by very fast data access generally less than microseconds are used primarily accelerate applications that would otherwise be held back by

data center product Intel Optane SSD DC P X Series following with client version Intel Optane SSD P Series in October Both products operate faster with higher endurance than NAND based SSDs while areal density comparable at gigabits per chip price per bit D XPoint more expensive than NAND but cheaper than DRAM Other edit This section s factual accuracy may be compromised due out date information Please update this article reflect recent events newly available information December Some SSDs called NVDIMM Hyper DIMM devices use both DRAM flash memory power goes down SSD copies all data from its DRAM flash power comes back up SSD copies all data from its flash its DRAM In somewhat similar way some SSDs use form factors buses actually designed DIMM modules while using only flash memory making it appear as if it were DRAM Such SSDs are usually known as ULLtraDIMM devices Drives known as hybrid drives solid state hybrid drives SSHDs use hybrid spinning disks flash memory Some SSDs use magnetoresistive random access memory MRAM storing data Cache buffer edit flash based SSD typically uses small amount DRAM as volatile cache similar buffers in hard disk drives directory block placement wear leveling data also kept in cache while drive operating One SSD controller manufacturer SandForce does not use an external DRAM cache on designs but still achieves high performance Such an elimination external DRAM reduces power consumption enables further size reduction SSDs Battery supercapacitor edit Another component in higher performing SSDs capacitor some form battery which are necessary maintain data integrity so data in cache can be flushed drive power lost some may even hold power long enough maintain data in cache until power resumed In case MLC flash memory problem called lower page corruption can occur MLC flash memory loses power while programming an upper page result that data written previously presumed safe can be corrupted if memory not supported

ordinary spinning HDDs difficult Traditional HDD benchmarks tend focus on performance characteristics that are poor with HDDs such as rotational latency seek time As SSDs do not need spin seek locate data they may prove vastly superior HDDs in such tests However SSDs have challenges with mixed reads writes performance may degrade over time SSD testing must start from in use full drive as new empty fresh out box drive may have much better write performance than it would show after only weeks use Most advantages solid state drives over traditional hard drives are due ability access data completely electronically instead electromechanically resulting in superior transfer speeds mechanical ruggedness On other hand hard disk drives offer significantly higher capacity price Some field failure rates indicate that SSDs are significantly more reliable than HDDs but others do not However SSDs are uniquely sensitive sudden power interruption resulting in aborted writes even cases

models were more common In HDDs up TB were available Reliability on storage retention If left without power worn out SSDs typically start lose data after about one two years in storage depending on temperature New drives are supposed retain data about ten years MLC TLC based devices tend lose data earlier than SLC based devices SSDs are not suited archival use If kept in dry environment at low temperature HDDs can retain data very long period time even without power However mechanical parts tend become clotted over time drive fails spin up after few years in storage Reliability lifetime SSDs have no moving parts fail mechanically so in theory should be more reliable than HDDs However in practice this unclear see also SSD reliability failure modes Each block flash based SSD can only be erased therefore written limited number times before it fails controllers manage this limitation so that drives can last many years under normal use SSDs based on DRAM do not have limited number writes However failure controller can make SSD unusable Reliability varies significantly across different SSD manufacturers models with return rates reaching specific drives Many SSDs critically fail on power outages December survey many SSDs found that only some them are able survive multiple power outages needs update HDDs have moving parts are subject potential mechanical failures from resulting wear tear so in theory should be less reliable than SSDs However in practice this unclear see also SSD reliability failure modes storage medium itself magnetic platter does not essentially degrade from read write operations According study performed by Carnegie Mellon University both consumer enterprise grade HDDs average failure rate years life expectancy years However risk sudden catastrophic data loss can be lower HDDs stored offline unpowered in shelf in long term magnetic medium HDD retains data significantly longer than flash memory used in SSDs Start up time Almost instantaneous no mechanical components prepare May need few milliseconds come out an automatic power saving mode Drive spin up may take several seconds system with many drives may need stagger spin up limit peak power drawn which briefly high an HDD first started Sequential access performance In consumer products maximum transfer rate typically ranges from about MB s MB s depending on drive Enterprise SSDs can have multi gigabyte per second throughput Once head positioned reading writing continuous track modern HDD can transfer data at about MB s Data transfer rate depends also upon rotational speed which can range from rpm also upon track reading from outer tracks faster Data transfer speed can be up MB s experimental Random access performance Random access time typically under ms As data can be retrieved directly from various locations flash memory access time usually not big performance bottleneck Read performance does not change based on data stored In applications hard disk drive seeks are limiting factor this results in faster boot application launch times see Amdahl s law SSD technology can deliver rather consistent read write speed but lots individual smaller blocks are accessed performance reduced SSDs suffer from write performance degradation phenomenon called write amplification NAND cells show measurable drop in performance will continue degrading throughout life SSD technique called wear leveling implemented mitigate this effect but due nature NAND chips drive will inevitably degrade at noticeable rate verification needed Read latency time much higher than SSDs Random access time ranges from high end server drive ms laptop HDD due need move heads wait data rotate under magnetic head Read time different every different seek since location data location head are likely different If data from different areas platter must be accessed as with fragmented files response times will be increased by need seek each fragment Impacts file system fragmentation limited benefit reading data sequentially beyond typical FS block sizes say KB making fragmentation negligible SSDs Defragmentation would cause wear by making additional writes NAND flash cells which have limited cycle life However even on SSDs practical limit on much fragmentation certain file systems can sustain once that limit reached subsequent file allocations fail Consequently defragmentation may still be necessary although lesser degree Some file systems like NTFS become fragmented over time if frequently written periodic defragmentation required maintain optimum performance This usually not an issue in modern file systems citation needed clarification needed Noise acoustic SSDs have no moving parts therefore are silent although on some SSDs high pitch noise from high voltage generator erasing blocks may occur HDDs have moving parts heads actuator spindle motor make characteristic sounds whirring clicking noise levels vary depending on RPM but can be significant while often much lower than sound from cooling fans Laptop hard drives are relatively quiet Temperature control study conducted by Facebook found consistent failure rate at temperatures between C Failure rate rises operating at temperatures higher than C further increase temperature may trigger thermal throttling around C resulting in reduced runtime performance Reliability early SSDs without thermal throttling are more affected by temperature than newer ones with thermal throttling In practice SSDs usually do not require any special cooling can tolerate higher temperatures than HDDs High end enterprise models installed as add on cards inch bay devices may ship with heat sinks dissipate generated heat requiring certain volumes airflow operate Ambient temperatures above C

inch inch but enclosures are made mostly plastic HDDs are generally heavier than SSDs as enclosures are made mostly metal they contain heavy objects such as motors large magnets inch drives typically weigh around grams about pounds Secure writing limitations NAND flash memory cannot be overwritten but has be rewritten previously erased blocks If software encryption program encrypts data already on SSD overwritten data still unsecured unencrypted accessible drive based hardware encryption does not have this problem Also data cannot be securely erased by overwriting original file without special Secure Erase procedures built into drive HDDs can overwrite data directly on drive in any particular sector However drive s firmware may exchange damaged blocks with spare areas so bits pieces may still be present Some manufacturers HDDs fill entire drive with zeroes including relocated sectors on ATA Secure Erase Enhanced Erase command Read write performance symmetry Less expensive SSDs

attributes which are optimized adjusted best meet needs particular users Some these characteristics include power consumption performance size reliability SSDs were originally designed use in computer system first units were intended replace augment hard disk drives so operating system recognized them as hard drive Originally solid state drives were even shaped mounted in computer like hard drives Later SSDs became smaller more compact eventually developing own unique form factors such as M form factor SSD was designed be installed permanently inside computer In contrast memory cards such as Secure Digital SD CompactFlash CF many others were originally designed digital cameras later found way into cell phones gaming devices GPS units etc Most memory cards are physically smaller than SSDs

needed typical CompactFlash card interface three four times slower than an SSD citation needed As memory cards are not designed tolerate amount reading writing which occurs during typical computer use data may get damaged unless special procedures are taken reduce wear on card minimum SSD failure edit SSDs have very different failure modes than traditional magnetic hard drives design some kinds failure are inapplicable motors magnetic heads cannot fail they are not needed in an SSD Instead other kinds failure are possible example incomplete failed writes due sudden power failure can be more problem than with HDDs if chip fails then all data on it lost scenario not applicable magnetic drives However on whole statistics show that SSDs are generally highly reliable often continue working far beyond expected lifetime as stated by manufacturer SSD reliability failure modes edit An early test by Techreport com which ran months during had previously tested number SSDs destruction identify at point they failed test found that All drives surpassed official endurance specifications by writing hundreds terabytes without issue described as being far beyond any usual size typical consumer first SSD fail was TLC based drive type design expected be less durable than either SLC MLC SSD concerned managed write over GB TB petabytes before failing three SSDs in test managed write almost three times that amount almost PB before they also failed So capability even consumer SSDs be remarkably reliable was already established study millions drive days in production use by SSDs over six year period reported that SSDs were replaced in year period concluded based upon annual failure rates HDDs published in that SSDs fail at significantly lower rate than HDDs however study HDDs million drive days reported annual failure rates comparable reported SSD rates that HDDs on average had calculated four year failure rate with lowest rate SDD study concluded SSD localized data loss due unreadable blocks be more problem than with HDDs It also contained number unexpected conclusions In real world MLC based designs believed less reliable than SLC designs are often as reliable as SLC findings state that SLC not generally more reliable than MLC Device age measured by days in use main factor in SSD reliability not amount data read written which are measured by TBW DWPD this finding persists after controlling early failure other factors it likely that factors such as silicon aging cause this trend correlation significant around Raw bit error rates RBER grows much slower than usually believed not exponential as often assumed nor it good predictor other errors SSD failure uncorrectable bit error rate UBER widely used but not good predictor failure either However SSD UBER rates are higher than those HDDs so although they do not predict failure they can lead data loss due unreadable blocks being more common on SSDs than HDDs conclusion states that although more reliable overall rate uncorrectable errors able impact user larger Bad blocks in new SSDs are common drives with large number bad blocks are much more likely lose hundreds other blocks most likely due die chip failure percent SSDs develop at least one bad block percent develop at least one bad chip in first four years deployment no sharp increase in errors after expected lifetime reached Most SSDs develop no more than few bad blocks perhaps SSDs that develop many bad blocks often go on develop far more perhaps hundreds may be prone failure However most drives are shipped with bad blocks from manufacture finding overall was that bad blocks are common drives will develop at least one in use but even few bad blocks predictor up hundreds bad blocks at later time bad block count at manufacture correlates with later development further bad blocks report conclusion added that SSDs tended either have less than handful bad blocks large number suggested that this might be basis predicting eventual failure Around SSDs will develop bad chips in first years use Over these chips will have breached manufacturers tolerances specifications which typically guarantee that no more than blocks on chip will fail within its expected write lifetime those SSDs that need repair warranty servicing need repair only once in life Days between repair vary from couple thousand days nearly days depending

internally by SSD Some flash file systems using log based designs F FS JFFS help reduce write amplification on SSDs especially in situations only very small amounts data are changed such as updating

supports TRIM with possibility turn them off select between one time continuous discard operations Support queued TRIM which SATA feature that results in TRIM commands not disrupting command queues was introduced in Linux kernel released on November An alternative kernel level TRIM operation use user space utility called fstrim that goes through all unused blocks in filesystem dispatches TRIM commands those areas fstrim utility usually run by cron as scheduled task As November update it used by Ubuntu Linux distribution in which it enabled only Intel Samsung solid state drives reliability reasons vendor check can be disabled by editing file etc cron weekly fstrim using instructions contained within file itself Since standard Linux drive utilities have taken care appropriate partition alignment by default Linux performance considerations edit An SSD that uses NVM Express as logical device interface in form PCI Express expansion card During installation Linux distributions usually do not configure installed system use TRIM thus etc fstab file requires manual modifications This notion that current Linux TRIM command implementation might not be optimal It has been proven cause performance degradation instead performance increase under certain circumstances As January update Linux sends an individual TRIM command each sector instead vectorized list defining TRIM range as recommended by TRIM specification This deficiency has existed years are no known plans eliminate it performance reasons it recommended switch O scheduler from default CFQ Completely Fair Queuing NOOP Deadline CFQ was designed traditional magnetic media seek optimizations thus many those O scheduling efforts are wasted used with SSDs As part designs SSDs offer much bigger levels parallelism O operations so it preferable leave scheduling decisions internal logic especially high end SSDs scalable block layer high performance SSD storage known as blk multiqueue blk mq developed primarily by Fusion io engineers was merged into Linux kernel mainline in kernel version released on January This leverages performance offered by SSDs NVM Express by allowing much higher O submission rates With this new design Linux kernel block layer internal queues are split into two levels per CPU hardware submission queues thus removing bottlenecks allowing much higher levels O parallelization As version Linux kernel released on April VirtIO block driver SCSI layer which used by Serial ATA drivers device mapper framework loop device driver unsorted block images UBI driver which implements erase block management layer flash memory devices RBD driver which exports Ceph RADOS objects as block devices have been modified actually use this new interface other drivers will be ported in following releases macOS edit Versions since Mac OS X Snow Leopard support TRIM but only used with an Apple purchased SSD TRIM not automatically enabled third party drives although it can be enabled by using third party utilities such as Trim Enabler status TRIM can be checked in System Information application in system profiler command line tool Versions since OS X Yosemite include sudo trimforce enable as Terminal command that enables TRIM on non Apple SSDs also technique enable TRIM in versions earlier than Mac OS X although it remains uncertain whether TRIM actually utilized properly in those cases Microsoft Windows edit Versions Microsoft Windows before do not take any special measures support solid state drives Starting from Windows standard NTFS file system provides TRIM support other file systems on Windows do not support TRIM By default Windows newer versions execute TRIM commands automatically if device detected be solid state drive change this behavior in Registry key HKEY LOCAL MACHINE SYSTEM CurrentControlSet Control FileSystem value DisableDeleteNotification can be set prevent mass storage driver from issuing TRIM command This can be useful in situations data recovery preferred over wear leveling in most cases TRIM irreversibly resets all freed space Windows implements TRIM command more than just file delete operations TRIM operation fully integrated with partition volume level commands like format delete with file system commands relating truncate compression with System Restore also known as Volume Snapshot feature Windows edit Windows later versions have native support SSDs operating system detects presence an SSD optimizes operation accordingly SSD devices Windows disables SuperFetch ReadyBoost boot time application prefetching operations citation needed Despite initial statement by Steven Sinofsky before release Windows however defragmentation not disabled even though its behavior on SSDs differs One reason low performance Volume Shadow Copy Service on fragmented SSDs second reason avoid reaching practical maximum number file fragments that volume can handle If this maximum reached subsequent attempts write drive will fail with an error message Windows also includes support TRIM command reduce garbage collection data which operating system has already determined no longer valid Without support TRIM SSD would be unaware this data being invalid would unnecessarily continue rewrite it during garbage collection causing further wear on SSD It beneficial make some changes that prevent SSDs from being treated more like HDDs example cancelling defragmentation not filling them more than about capacity not storing frequently written files such as log temporary files on them if hard drive available enabling TRIM process Windows edit Windows later Windows systems like Windows also support automatic TRIM PCI Express SSDs based on NVMe Windows KB update required this functionality needs be integrated into Windows Setup using DISM if Windows has be installed on NVMe SSD Windows also support SCSI unmap command USB attached SSDs SATA USB enclosures SCSI Unmap full analog SATA TRIM command It also supported over USB Attached SCSI Protocol UASP graphical Windows Disk Defagmenter in Windows also recognizes SSDs distinctly from hard disk drives in separate Media Type column While Windows supported automatic TRIM internal SATA SSDs Windows Windows support manual TRIM via an Optimize function in Disk Defragmenter as well as automatic TRIM SATA NVMe USB attached SSDs Windows Vista edit Windows Vista generally expects hard disk drives rather than SSDs Windows Vista includes ReadyBoost exploit characteristics USB connected flash devices but SSDs it only improves default partition alignment prevent read modify write operations that reduce speed SSDs Most SSDs are typically split into kB sectors while most systems are based on byte sectors with default partition setups unaligned KB boundaries proper alignment does not help SSD s endurance over life drive however some Vista operations if not disabled can shorten life SSD Drive defragmentation should be disabled location file components on an SSD doesn t significantly impact its performance but moving files make them contiguous using Windows Defrag routine will cause unnecessary write wear on limited number P E cycles on SSD Superfetch feature will not materially improve performance system causes additional overhead in system SSD although it does not cause wear Windows Vista does not send TRIM command solid state drives but some third part utilities such as SSD Doctor will periodically scan drive TRIM appropriate entries ZFS edit Solaris as version Update released in October recent versions OpenSolaris Solaris Express Community Edition Illumos Linux with ZFS on Linux FreeBSD all can use SSDs as performance booster ZFS low latency SSD can be used ZFS Intent Log ZIL it named SLOG This used every time synchronous write drive occurs An SSD not necessarily with low latency may also be used level Adaptive Replacement Cache L ARC which used cache data reading used either alone in combination large increases in performance are generally seen FreeBSD edit ZFS FreeBSD introduced support TRIM on September code builds map regions data that were freed on every write code consults map eventually removes ranges that were freed before but are now overwritten low priority thread that TRIMs ranges time comes Also Unix File System UFS supports TRIM command Swap partitions edit According Microsoft s former Windows division president Steven Sinofsky are few files better than pagefile place on an SSD According collected telemetry data Microsoft had found pagefile sys be an ideal match SSD storage Linux swap partitions are by default performing TRIM operations underlying block device supports TRIM with possibility turn them off select between one time continuous TRIM operations If an operating system does not support using TRIM on discrete swap partitions it might be possible use swap files inside an ordinary file system instead example OS X does not support swap partitions it only swaps files within file system so it can use TRIM example swap files are deleted citation needed DragonFly BSD allows SSD configured swap also be used as file system cache This can be used boost performance on both desktop server workloads bcache dm cache Flashcache projects provide similar concept Linux kernel Standardization organizations edit following are noted standardization organizations bodies that work create standards solid
