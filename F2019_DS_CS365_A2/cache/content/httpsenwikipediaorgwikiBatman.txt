being given byline creating Wonder Woman Batman stories began saying Created by Bob Kane in addition other credits Finger did not receive same recognition While he had received credit other DC work since s he began in s receive limited acknowledgment his Batman writing in letters page Batman February example editor Julius Schwartz names him as creator Riddler one Batman s recurring villains However Finger s contract left him only with his writing page rate no byline Kane wrote Bill was disheartened by lack major accomplishments in his career He felt that he had not used his creative potential its fullest that success had passed him by At time Finger s death in DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co creator Jerry Robinson also worked with Finger Kane on strip at this time has criticized Kane failing share credit He recalled Finger resenting his position stating in interview with Comics Journal Bob made him more insecure while he slaved working on Batman he wasn t sharing in any glory money that Bob began make which he was going leave Kane s employ Kane should have credited Bill as co creator know was That was one thing would never forgive Bob was not take care Bill recognize his vital role in creation Batman As with Siegel Shuster it should have been same same co creator credit in strip writer artist Although Kane initially rebutted Finger s claims at having created character writing in open letter fans that it seemed me that Bill Finger has given out impression that he not myself created Batman t sic as well as Robin all other leading villains characters This statement fraudulent entirely untrue Kane himself also commented on Finger s lack credit trouble with being ghost writer artist that must remain rather anonymously without credit However if one wants credit then one has cease being ghost follower become leader innovator In Kane revisited Finger s situation recalling in an interview In those days it was like one artist he had his name over it comic strip policy DC in comic books was if can t write it obtain other writers but names would never appear on comic book in finished version So Bill never asked me it byline never
