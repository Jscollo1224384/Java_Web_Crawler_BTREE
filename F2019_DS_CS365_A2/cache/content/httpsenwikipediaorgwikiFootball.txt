simply stood between ball goal which was objective Players were not allowed pass ball forward either by foot by hand They could only dribble with feet advance ball in scrum similar formation However offside laws began diverge develop differently at each school as shown by rules football from Winchester Rugby Harrow Cheltenham during between first known codes in sense set rules were those Eton in

many children were part labour force Feast day football played on streets was in decline Public school boys enjoyed some freedom from work became inventors organised football games with formal codes rules Football was adopted by number public schools as way encouraging competitiveness keeping youths fit Each school drafted its own rules which varied widely between different schools were changed

showed disregard was running forward with it as rules his time only allowed player retreat backwards kick forwards boom in rail transport in Britain during s meant that people were able travel further with less inconvenience than they ever had before Inter school sporting competitions became possible However it was difficult schools play each other at football as each school played by its own rules solution this problem was usually that match be divided into two halves one half played by rules host home school other half by visiting away school modern rules many football codes were formulated during mid late th century This also applies other sports such as lawn bowls lawn tennis etc major impetus this was patenting world s first lawnmower in This allowed preparation modern ovals playing
