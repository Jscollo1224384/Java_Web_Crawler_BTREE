Computer data storage often called storage technology consisting computer components recording media that are used retain digital data It core function fundamental component computers central processing unit CPU computer manipulates data by performing computations In practice almost all computers use storage hierarchy which puts fast but expensive small storage options close CPU slower but larger cheaper options farther away Generally fast volatile technologies which lose data off power are referred as memory while slower persistent technologies are referred as storage Even very first computer designs Charles Babbage s Analytical Engine Percy Ludgate s Analytical Machine clearly distinguished between processing memory Babbage stored numbers as rotations gears while Ludgate stored numbers as displacements rods in shuttles This distinction was extended in Von Neumann architecture CPU consists two main parts control unit arithmetic logic unit ALU former controls flow data between CPU memory while latter performs arithmetic logical operations on data Contents Functionality Data organization representation Hierarchy storage Primary storage Secondary storage Tertiary storage Off

reading Functionality edit Without significant amount memory computer would merely be able perform fixed operations immediately output result It would have be reconfigured change its behavior This acceptable devices such as desk calculators digital signal processors other specialized devices Von Neumann machines differ in having memory in which they store operating instructions data Such computers are more versatile in that they do not need have hardware reconfigured each new program but can simply be reprogrammed with new in memory instructions they also tend be simpler design in that relatively simple processor may keep state between successive computations build up complex procedural results Most modern computers are von Neumann machines Data organization representation edit modern digital computer represents data using binary numeral system Text numbers pictures audio nearly any other form information can be converted into string bits binary digits each which has value most common unit storage byte equal bits piece information can be handled by any computer device whose storage space large enough accommodate binary representation piece information simply data example complete works Shakespeare about pages in print can be stored in about five megabytes million bits with one byte per character Data are encoded by assigning bit pattern each character digit multimedia object Many standards exist encoding e g character encodings like ASCII image encodings like JPEG video encodings like MPEG By adding bits each encoded unit redundancy allows computer both detect errors in coded data correct them based on mathematical algorithms Errors generally occur in low probabilities due random bit value flipping physical bit fatigue loss physical bit in storage its ability maintain distinguishable value due errors in inter intra computer communication random bit flip e g due random radiation typically corrected upon detection bit group malfunctioning physical bits not always specific defective bit known group definition depends on specific storage device typically automatically fenced out taken out use by device replaced with another functioning equivalent group in device corrected bit values are restored if possible cyclic redundancy check CRC method typically used in communications storage error detection detected error then retried Data compression methods allow in many cases such as database represent string bits by shorter bit string compress reconstruct original string decompress needed This utilizes substantially less storage tens percents many types data at cost more computation compress decompress needed Analysis trade off between storage cost saving costs related computations possible delays in data availability done before deciding whether keep certain data compressed not security reasons certain types data e g credit card information may be kept encrypted in storage prevent possibility unauthorized information reconstruction from chunks storage snapshots Hierarchy storage edit Main article Memory hierarchy This article appears contradict article Memory hierarchy Please see discussion on linked talk page March Learn remove this template message Various forms storage divided according distance from central processing unit fundamental components general purpose computer are arithmetic logic unit control circuitry storage space input output devices Technology capacity as in common home computers around Generally lower storage in hierarchy lesser its bandwidth greater its access latency from CPU This traditional division storage primary secondary tertiary off line storage also guided by cost per bit In contemporary usage memory usually semiconductor storage read write random access memory typically DRAM dynamic RAM other forms fast but temporary storage Storage consists storage devices media not directly accessible by CPU secondary tertiary storage typically hard disk drives optical disc drives other devices slower than RAM but non volatile retaining contents powered down Historically memory has been called core memory main memory real storage internal memory Meanwhile non volatile storage devices have been referred as secondary storage external memory auxiliary peripheral storage Primary storage edit Main article Computer memory Primary storage also known as main memory internal memory prime memory often referred simply as memory only one directly accessible CPU CPU continuously reads instructions stored executes them as required Any data actively operated on also stored in uniform manner Historically early computers used delay lines Williams tubes rotating magnetic drums as primary storage By those unreliable methods were mostly replaced by magnetic core memory Core memory remained dominant until s advances in integrated circuit technology allowed semiconductor memory become economically competitive This led modern random access memory RAM It small sized light but quite expensive at same time particular types RAM used primary storage are also volatile i e they lose information not powered As shown in diagram traditionally are two more sub layers primary storage besides main large capacity RAM Processor registers are located inside processor Each register typically holds word data often bits CPU instructions instruct arithmetic logic unit perform various calculations other operations on this data with help it Registers are fastest all forms computer data storage Processor cache an intermediate stage between ultra fast registers much slower main memory It was introduced solely improve performance computers Most actively used information in main memory just duplicated in cache memory which faster but much lesser capacity On other hand main memory much slower but has much greater storage capacity than processor registers Multi level hierarchical cache setup also commonly used primary cache being smallest fastest located inside processor secondary cache being somewhat larger slower Main memory directly indirectly connected central processing unit via memory bus It actually two buses not on diagram an address bus data bus CPU firstly sends number through an address bus number called memory address that indicates desired location data Then it reads writes data in memory cells using data bus Additionally memory management unit MMU small device between CPU RAM recalculating actual memory address example provide an abstraction virtual memory other tasks As RAM types used primary storage are volatile uninitialized at start up computer containing only such storage would not have source read instructions from in order start computer Hence non volatile primary storage containing small startup program BIOS used bootstrap computer that read larger program from non volatile secondary storage RAM start execute it non volatile technology used this purpose called ROM read only memory terminology may be somewhat confusing as most ROM types are also capable random access Many types ROM are not literally read only as updates them are possible however it slow memory must be erased in large portions before it can be re written Some embedded systems run programs directly from ROM similar such programs are rarely changed Standard computers do not store non rudimentary programs in ROM rather use large capacities secondary storage which non volatile as well not as costly Recently primary storage secondary storage in some uses refer was historically called respectively secondary storage tertiary storage Secondary storage edit hard disk drive with protective cover removed Secondary storage also known as external memory auxiliary storage differs from primary storage in that it not directly accessible by CPU computer usually uses its input output channels access secondary storage transfer desired data primary storage Secondary storage non volatile retaining data power shut off Modern computer systems typically have two orders magnitude more secondary storage than primary storage secondary storage less expensive In modern computers hard disk drives HDDs solid state drives SSDs are usually used as secondary storage access time per byte HDDs SSDs typically measured in milliseconds one thousandth seconds while access time per byte primary storage measured in nanoseconds one billionth seconds Thus secondary storage significantly slower than primary storage Rotating optical storage devices such as CD DVD drives have even longer access times Other examples secondary storage technologies include USB flash drives floppy disks magnetic tape paper tape punched cards RAM disks Once disk read write head on HDDs reaches proper placement data subsequent data on track are very fast access reduce seek time rotational latency data are transferred from disks in large contiguous blocks Sequential block access on disks orders magnitude faster than random access many sophisticated paradigms have been developed design efficient algorithms based upon sequential block access Another way reduce O bottleneck use multiple disks in parallel in order increase bandwidth between primary secondary memory Secondary storage often formatted according file system format which provides abstraction necessary organize data into files directories while also providing metadata describing owner certain file access time access permissions other information Most computer operating systems use concept virtual memory allowing utilization more primary storage capacity than physically available in system As primary memory fills up system moves least used chunks pages swap file page file on secondary storage retrieving them later needed If lot pages are moved slower secondary storage system performance degraded Tertiary storage edit See also Nearline storage Cloud storage large tape library with tape cartridges placed on shelves in front robotic arm moving in back Visible height library about cm Tertiary storage tertiary memory level below secondary storage Typically it involves robotic mechanism which will mount insert dismount removable mass storage media into storage device according system s demands such data are often copied secondary storage before use It primarily used archiving rarely accessed information since it much slower than secondary storage e g seconds vs milliseconds This primarily useful extraordinarily large data stores accessed without human operators Typical examples include tape libraries optical jukeboxes computer needs read information from tertiary storage it will first consult catalog database determine which tape disc contains information Next computer will instruct robotic arm fetch medium place it in drive computer has finished reading information robotic arm will return medium its place in library Tertiary storage also known as nearline storage it near online formal distinction between online nearline offline storage Online storage immediately available O Nearline storage not immediately available but can be made online quickly without human intervention Offline storage not immediately available requires some human intervention become online example always on spinning hard disk drives are online storage while spinning drives that spin down automatically such as in massive arrays idle disks MAID are nearline storage Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded as in tape libraries are nearline storage while tape cartridges that must be manually loaded are offline storage Off line storage edit Off line storage computer data storage on medium device that not under control processing unit medium recorded usually in secondary tertiary storage device then physically removed disconnected It must be inserted connected by human operator before computer can access it again Unlike tertiary storage it cannot be accessed without human interaction Off line storage used transfer information since detached medium can be easily physically transported Additionally in case disaster example fire destroys original data medium in remote location will probably be unaffected enabling disaster recovery Off line storage increases general information security since it physically inaccessible from computer data confidentiality integrity cannot be affected by computer based attack techniques Also if information stored archival purposes rarely accessed off line storage less expensive than tertiary storage In modern personal computers most secondary tertiary storage media are also used off line storage Optical discs flash memory devices are most popular much lesser extent removable hard disk drives In enterprise uses magnetic tape predominant Older examples are floppy disks Zip disks punched cards Characteristics storage edit GB module laptop DDR RAM Storage technologies at all levels storage hierarchy can be differentiated by evaluating certain core characteristics as well as measuring characteristics specific particular implementation These core characteristics are volatility mutability accessibility addressability any particular implementation any storage technology characteristics worth measuring are capacity performance Volatility edit Non volatile memory retains stored information even if not constantly supplied with electric power It suitable long term storage information Volatile memory requires constant power maintain stored information fastest memory technologies are volatile ones although that not universal rule Since primary storage required be very fast it predominantly uses volatile memory Dynamic random access memory form volatile memory that also requires stored information be periodically reread rewritten refreshed otherwise it would vanish Static random access memory form volatile memory similar DRAM with exception that it never needs be refreshed as long as power applied it loses its content power supply lost An uninterruptible power supply UPS can be used give computer brief window time move information from primary volatile storage into non volatile storage before batteries are exhausted Some systems example EMC Symmetrix have integrated batteries that maintain volatile storage several minutes Mutability edit Read write storage mutable storage Allows information be overwritten at any time computer without some amount read write storage primary storage purposes would be useless many tasks Modern computers typically use read write storage also secondary storage Slow write fast read storage Read write storage which allows information be overwritten multiple times but with write operation being much slower than read operation Examples include CD RW SSD Write once storage Write Once Read Many WORM allows information be written only once at some point after manufacture Examples include semiconductor programmable read only memory CD R Read only storage Retains information stored at time manufacture Examples include mask ROM ICs CD ROM Accessibility edit Random access Any location in storage can be accessed at any moment in approximately same amount time Such characteristic well suited primary secondary storage Most semiconductor memories disk drives provide random access Sequential access accessing pieces information will be in serial order one after other therefore time access particular piece information depends upon which piece information was last accessed Such characteristic typical off line storage Addressability edit Location addressable Each individually accessible unit information in storage selected with its numerical memory address In modern computers location addressable storage usually limits primary storage accessed internally by computer programs since location addressability very efficient but burdensome humans File addressable Information divided into files variable length particular file selected with human readable directory file names underlying device still location addressable but operating system computer provides file system abstraction make operation more understandable In modern computers secondary tertiary off line storage use file systems Content addressable Each individually accessible unit information selected based on basis part contents stored Content addressable storage can be implemented using software computer program hardware computer device with hardware being faster but more expensive option Hardware content addressable memory often used in computer s CPU cache

It storage capacity medium divided with unit length area volume e g megabytes per square inch Performance edit Latency time it takes access particular location in storage relevant unit measurement typically nanosecond primary storage millisecond secondary storage second tertiary storage It may make sense separate read latency write latency especially non volatile memory in case sequential access storage minimum maximum average latency Throughput rate at which information can be read from written storage In computer data storage throughput usually expressed in terms megabytes per second MB s though bit rate may also be used As with latency read rate write rate may need be differentiated Also accessing media sequentially as opposed randomly typically yields maximum throughput Granularity size largest chunk data that can be efficiently accessed as single unit e g without introducing additional latency Reliability probability spontaneous bit value change under various conditions overall failure rate Utilities such as hdparm sar can be used measure IO performance in Linux Energy use edit Storage devices that reduce fan usage automatically shut down during inactivity low power hard drives can reduce energy consumption by percent inch hard disk drives often consume less power than larger ones Low capacity solid state drives have no moving parts consume less power than hard disks Also memory may use more power than hard disks Large caches which are used avoid hitting memory wall may also consume large amount power Security edit Full disk encryption volume

See also Storage replication While group bits malfunction may be resolved by error detection correction mechanisms see above storage device malfunction requires different solutions following solutions are commonly used valid most storage devices Device mirroring replication common solution problem constantly maintaining an identical copy device content on another device typically same type downside that this doubles storage both devices copies need be updated simultaneously with some overhead possibly some delays upside possible concurrent read same data group by two independent processes which increases performance one replicated devices detected be defective other copy still operational being utilized generate new copy on another device usually available operational in pool stand by devices this purpose Redundant array independent disks RAID This method generalizes device mirroring above by allowing one device in group N devices fail be replaced with content restored Device mirroring RAID with N RAID groups N N are common N saves storage comparing with N at cost more processing during both regular operation with often reduced performance defective device replacement Device mirroring typical RAID are designed handle single device failure in RAID group devices However if second failure occurs before RAID group completely repaired from first failure then data can be lost probability single failure typically small Thus probability two failures in same RAID group in time proximity much smaller approximately probability squared i e multiplied by itself If database cannot tolerate even such smaller probability data loss then RAID group itself replicated mirrored In many cases such mirroring done geographically remotely in different storage array handle also
