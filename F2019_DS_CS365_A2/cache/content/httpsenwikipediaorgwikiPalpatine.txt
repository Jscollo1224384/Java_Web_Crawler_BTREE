Luceno Lucasfilm Story Group approached Del Rey Books asked if they wanted use name which was created by George Lucas in Tarkin novel which Del Rey agreed Character creation Lucas conceptualization Palpatine role character plays in Star Wars changed over time From Return Jedi onwards Palpatine became ultimate personification evil in Star Wars replacing Darth Vader as central villain original Star Wars trilogy was filmed Emperor was unnamed his throne world unidentified name would not be used in film until prequel trilogy first mention name Palpatine came from prologue Alan Dean Foster s novelization New Hope which detailed Emperor s rise power Foster writes Aided abetted by restless power hungry individuals within government massive organs commerce ambitious Senator Palpatine caused himself be elected President Republic He promised reunite disaffected among people restore remembered glory Republic Once secure in office he declared himself Emperor shutting himself away from populace Soon he was controlled by very assistants boot lickers he had appointed high office cries people justice did not reach his ears It unclear whether Lucas intended Palpatine be reigning Emperor just first succession emperors In Secret History Star Wars Michael Kaminski states that Lucas initial notes discuss line corrupt emperors not just one If Palpatine was first Kaminski infers he would therefore not be current emperor However by time Return Jedi its novelization Palpatine was made name current emperor During story conferences Empire Strikes Back Lucas Leigh Brackett decided that Emperor Force had be two main concerns in film Emperor had barely been dealt with in first movie intention in sequel was deal with him on more concrete level Lucas ultimately decided instead focus on Emperor in Return Jedi U S President Richard Nixon was an influence in development Palpatine character In that film initial conception Palpatine was superseded by his depiction as dictatorial ruler adept in dark side Force Emperor was inspired by villain Ming Merciless from Flash Gordon comic books characterization Palpatine as an ambitious ruthless politician dismantling democratic republic achieve supreme power in part inspired by real world examples Julius Caesar Napoleon Bonaparte Adolf Hitler Other elements character come from Richard Nixon d Lucas said that Nixon s presidency got me thinking historically about do democracies get turned into dictatorships democracies aren t overthrown they re given away Lucas also said whole point movies underlying element that makes movies work that whether go backwards forwards start out in democracy democracy turns into dictatorship then rebels make it back into democracy Lucas wanted establish Emperor as true source evil in Star Wars Screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan noted My sense relationship between Darth Vader Emperor that Emperor much more powerful that Vader very much intimidated by him Vader has dignity but Emperor in Jedi really has all power He explained that climax film confrontation between Darth Vader his master In first scene that shows Emperor he arrives at Death Star greeted by host stormtroopers technicians other personnel Lucas states he wanted it look like military parades on May Day in Russia Lucas fleshed out Emperor in prequel films According Lucas Palpatine s role in Phantom Menace explain Anakin Skywalker came be Palpatine s apprentice events that led his rise power According film critic Jonathan L Bowen Debates raged on Internet concerning relationship between Darth Sidious Senator Palpatine Most fans believed two characters are actually same person with logic seeming support conclusion Bowen notes that debate was fueled by fact that suspiciously Darth Sidious does not appear in credits Augustus in robes cloak his position as Pontifex Maximus In Star Wars History published by Lucasfilm it describes Palpatine s consolidation power as being similar Roman political figure Augustus Both legitimized authoritarian rule by saying that corruption in Senate was hampering powers head state both pressured Senate grant extraordinary powers deal with crisis falsely claiming that they would rescind those powers once crisis was over both relied on strong control over military force Portrayal Emperor first appeared in Empire Strikes Back he was portrayed by Marjorie Eaton under heavy makeup Chimpanzee eyes were superimposed into darkened eye sockets during post production in order create truly unsettling image character was voiced by Clive Revill makeup was sculpted by Phil Tippett applied by Rick Baker initially used his own wife Elaine makeup tests With director Irvin Kershner Revill said had keep reins tight couldn t go overboard It was perfect example old adage less more Emperor doesn t say very much But he finally appears it s at point in saga everyone s waiting see him It s Emperor arch villain all time he says s great disturbance in Force mean that s enough oomph Years later during production Revenge Sith Lucas decided shoot new footage Empire Strikes Back create continuity between prequels original trilogy Thus in DVD release Empire Strikes Back Special Edition original version Emperor was replaced by Scottish Shakespearean actor Ian McDiarmid dialogue between Emperor Darth Vader was revised Lucas director Richard Marquand cast McDiarmid play Emperor Palpatine Return Jedi He was in his late s had never played leading role in feature film though he had made minor appearances in films like Dragonslayer After Return Jedi he resumed stage acting in London In an interview with BackStage McDiarmid revealed that he never had his sights set on film career never even auditioned role Palpatine He elaborated got called in interview after Return Jedi casting director saw me perform in Sam Shepard play Seduced at studio theatre at Royal Court was playing dying Howard Hughes McDiarmid was surprised Lucas approached him years after Return Jedi reprise role Palpatine In an interview he stated we were doing Return Jedi was rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head he d clearly just completed three them McDiarmid added Someone said that Oh think he might do next go back in time show Vader came be It never occurred me in million years that would be involved in that thought oh well then he ll get much younger actor play Palpatine That would be obvious However was right age ironically first prequel it was made So was in very strange rather wonderful paradox playing myself young at my own age having played myself previously don t know Palpatine s role in prequel films required McDiarmid play two dimensions same character Recalling initial days shooting Phantom Menace McDiarmid stated Stepping onto set Episode first time was like going back in time due my experience in Jedi Palpatine s an interesting character he s conventional on outside but demonic on inside he s on edge trying go beyond s possible McDiarmid added another layer character in Attack Clones He noted Palpatine supreme actor He has be even more convincing than somebody isn t behaving in schizophrenic fashion so he s extra charming extra professional those are looking clues that s almost can see them McDiarmid illuminated on scene Padm Amidala almost assassinated s moment in one scene new film tears almost appear in his eye These are crocodile tears but all those in movie perhaps watching movie itself they ll see he apparently moved course he He can just do it He can as it were turn it on suppose him it s also bit turn on pure exercise power he s all about That s only thing he s interested in only thing that can satisfy him which makes him completely fascinating play it an evil soul He more evil than devil At least Satan fell he has history it s one revenge In Revenge Sith McDiarmid played darker interpretation character He explained that re playing character solid blackness that in itself very interesting in sense that have no other motivation other than accumulation power It s not so much about not having moral center it s just that only thing that mattered increasing power He admitted ve been trying find redeeming feature Palpatine only one ve got so far that he s clearly patron arts he goes opera McDiarmid compared character Iago from William Shakespeare s Othello Everything he does an act pure hypocrisy that s interesting play suppose it s rather like playing Iago All characters in play including Othello until end think that Honest Iago decent guy doing his job he s quite liked But at same time s tremendous evil subconscious in operation McDiarmid noticed that script Revenge Sith demanded more action from his character than in previous films Lightsaber combat was challenge year old actor like his costars took fencing lessons close up shots non acrobatic sequences duel between Palpatine Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid Advanced fencing acrobatic stunts were executed by McDiarmid s doubles Michael Byrne Sebastian Dickins Bob Bowles McDiarmid s performance as Palpatine was generally well received by critics Todd McCarthy Variety commented Entertaining from start finish even enthralling at times Sith has some acting worth writing home about specifically McDiarmid s dominant turn as mastermind evil empire Ed Halter Village Voice wrote that Ian McDiarmid s unctuous Emperor turns appropriately vampiric as he attempts draw Anakin into Sith fold with promises eternal life Still his performance was not without detractors David Edelstein Slate critiqued McDiarmid isn t subtlest satanic tempters With his lisp his clammy little leer he looks like an old queen keen on trading an aging butt boy Count Dooku fresh meat which leaves Anakin looking more more like watt bulb McDiarmid had expressed interest in reprising role Palpatine in planned Star Wars Underworld TV series which remains un produced but according Cory Barlog would have depicted character as sympathetic figure was wronged by this fucking heartless woman She s this hardcore gangster she just totally destroyed him as person Make up costumes Chancellor Palpatine s robes from Episode III Transforming McDiarmid into Emperor Palpatine in Return Jedi required extensive makeup McDiarmid remarked in an interview with Star Wars Insider Yes that was four hour job initially although we got it down about two half in end But this was just little bit latex here little bit skin scrunching Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that Emperor looks uncannily like Death in Seventh Seal film historian Robin Wood compares him hag from Snow White Seven Dwarfs McDiarmid remarked my face changes in Revenge Sith my mind went back early silent movie Phantom Opera with Lon Chaney Conversely he required little makeup in Phantom Menace Attack Clones He recalled m slightly aged in AotC In last film had fairly standard make up on but now they re starting crinkle my face Palpatine s wardrobe in prequels tailored by costume designer Trisha Biggar played an important part in development character In Attack Clones explained McDiarmid costumes have got much more edge them think than mere senator had in Phantom Menace So we see trappings power On Revenge Sith McDiarmid said that wear costumes as character play wonderfully empowering McDiarmid s favorite costume in film was high collared jacket that resembles snake lizard skin He stated that it just feels reptilian which exactly right Palpatine According Biggar character s costumes proved most daunting challenge She said His six costumes get progressively darker more ornately decorated throughout movie He wears greys browns almost going black taking him toward dark side In popular culture With premiere Return Jedi prequel films accompanying merchandising campaign Palpatine became an icon in American popular culture Kenner Hasbro produced marketed series action figures character from According John Shelton Lawrence Robert Jewett These action figures allow children up handle symbols Force Academics have debated relationship Palpatine modern culture Religion scholars Ross Shepard Kraemer William Cassidy Susan Schwartz compare Palpatine Star Wars heroes theological concept dualism They insist One can certainly picture evil emperor in Star Wars as Satan complete with his infernal powers leading his faceless minions such as his red robed Imperial Guards Lawrence Jewett argue that Vader killing Palpatine in Return Jedi represented permanent subduing evil Since Return Jedi prequel films Palpatine s name has been invoked as caricature in politics Seattle Post Intelligencer editorial noted that anti pork bloggers were caricaturing West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd as Emperor Palpatine pork with Senator Ted Stevens Alaska having clear aspirations be his Darth Vader charge followed report that linked secret hold on Federal Funding Accountability Transparency Act two senators Politicians have made comparisons as well In Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg New Jersey compared Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist Tennessee Palpatine in speech on Senate floor complete with visual aid Fox News editorial stated no cultural icon can exist without someone trying stuff it into political ideology Star Wars saga greatest pop culture icon last three decades no exception Palpatine s dissolution Senate in favor imperial rule has been compared Julius Caesar s marginalization Roman Senate Hitler s power grab as chancellor FDR s court packing scheme creation imperial presidency On Internet After Disney s purchase Lucasfilm in sequel trilogy s success in mid late s character became subject various internet memes emphasizing certain lines dialogue character spoke in Star Wars Revenge Sith References Footnotes DVD subsequent releases Episode
