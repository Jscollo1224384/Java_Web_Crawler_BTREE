traditions edit Throughout time societies have proposed several explanations abnormal behavior within human beings Beginning in some hunter gatherer societies animists have believed that people demonstrating abnormal behavior are possessed by malevolent spirits This idea has been associated with trepanation practice cutting hole into individual s skull in order release malevolent spirits Although it has been difficult define abnormal psychology one definition includes characteristics such as statistical infrequency more formalized response spiritual beliefs about abnormality practice exorcism Performed by religious authorities exorcism thought as another way release evil spirits cause pathological behavior within person In some instances individuals exhibiting unusual thoughts behaviors have been exiled from society worse Perceived witchcraft example has been punished by death Two Catholic Inquisitors wrote Malleus Maleficarum Latin Hammer Against Witches that was used by many Inquisitors witch hunters It contained an early taxonomy perceived deviant behavior proposed guidelines prosecuting deviant individuals Asylums edit act placing mentally ill individuals in separate facility known as an asylum dates King Henry VIII England established St Mary Bethlehem asylum in London This hospital nicknamed Bedlam was famous its deplorable conditions Asylums remained popular throughout Middle Ages Renaissance era These early asylums were often in miserable conditions Patients were seen as burden society locked away treated almost as beasts be dealt with rather than patients needing treatment However many patients received helpful medical treatment was scientific curiosity into abnormal behavior although it was rarely investigated in early asylums Inmates in these early asylums were often put on display profit as they were viewed as less than human early asylums were basically modifications existing criminal institutions In late th century idea humanitarian treatment patients gained much favor due work Philippe Pinel in France He pushed idea that patients should be treated with kindness not cruelty inflicted on them as if they were animals criminals His experimental ideas such as removing chains from patients were met with reluctance experiments in kindness proved be great success which helped bring about reform in way mental institutions would be run examples perspective in this section may not represent worldwide view subject may improve this section discuss issue on talk page create new article as appropriate May Learn remove this template message Institutionalization would continue improve throughout th th century due work many humanitarians such as Dorethea Dix mental hygiene movement which promoted physical well being mental patients Dix more than any other figure in nineteenth century made people in America virtually all Europe aware that insane were being subjected incredible abuses Through this movement millions dollars were raised build new institutions house mentally ill Mental hospitals began grow substantially in numbers during th century as care mentally ill increased in them By were over patients in state mental hospitals in USA Hospital stays were normally quite long patients with some individuals being treated many years These hospitals while better than asylums past were still lacking in means effective treatment patients even though reform movement had occurred patients were often still met with cruel inhumane treatment Things began change in year Mary Jane Ward published influential book titled Snake Pit which was made into popular movie same name book called attention conditions which mental patients faced helped spark concern in general public create more humane mental health care in these overcrowded hospitals In this same year National Institute Mental Health was also created which provided support training hospital employees research into conditions which afflicted patients During this period Hill Burton Acts was also passed which was program that funded mental health hospitals Along with Community Health Services Act Hill Burton Acts helped with creation outpatient psychiatric clinics inpatient general hospitals rehabilitation community consultation centers Deinstitutionalisation edit neutrality this section disputed Relevant discussion may be found on talk page Please do not remove this message until conditions do so are met May Learn remove this template message In late twentieth century however large number mental hospitals were closed due lack funding overpopulation In England example only psychiatric institutions that had been created in early th century remained open at start st century In President John Kennedy launched community health movement in United States as bold new approach mental health care aimed at coordinating mental health services citizens in mental health centers In span years United States was able see an about percent drop in number patients in Psychiatric hospitals This trend was not only in England United States but worldwide with countries like Australia having many mentally ill patients not enough treatment facilities Recent studies have found that prevalence mental illness has not decreased significantly in past years has in fact increased in frequency regarding specific conditions such as anxiety mood disorders This led large number patients being released while not being fully cured disorder they were hospitalized This became known as phenomenon deinstitutionalization This movement had noble goals treating individuals outside isolated mental hospital by placing them into communities support systems Another goal this movement was avoid potential negative adaptations that can come with long term hospital confinements Many professionals example were concerned that patients would find permanent refuge in mental hospitals which would take them up demands everyday life were difficult However patients moved community living have not fared well typically as they often speak they feel abandoned by doctors used treat them It also has had unfortunate effect placing many patients in homelessness Many safe havens deinstitutionalized mentally ill have been created but it nevertheless estimated that around people are currently homeless have some form mental illness placing these individuals in homelessness major concern wellbeing as added stress living on streets not beneficial individual recover from particular disorder with which they are afflicted In fact while some homeless are able find some temporary relief in form shelters many homeless with mental illness lack safe decent shelter Explaining abnormal behaviour edit People have tried explain control abnormal behavior thousands years Historically have been three main approaches abnormal behavior supernatural biological psychological traditions Abnormal psychology revolves around two major paradigms explaining mental disorders psychological paradigm biological paradigm psychological paradigm focuses more on humanistic cognitive behavioral causes effects psychopathology biological paradigm includes theories that focus more on physical factors such as genetics neurochemistry Supernatural explanations edit In first supernatural tradition also called demonological method abnormal behaviors are attributed agents outside human bodies According this model abnormal behaviors are caused by demons spirits influences moon planets stars During Stone Age trepanning was performed on those had mental illness literally cut evil spirits out victim s head Conversely Ancient Chinese Ancient Egyptians Hebrews believed that these were evil demons spirits advocated exorcism By time Greeks Romans mental illnesses were thought be caused by an imbalance four humors leading draining fluids from brain During Medieval period many Europeans believed that power witches demons spirits caused abnormal behaviors People with psychological disorders were thought be possessed by evil spirits that had be exercised through religious rituals If exorcism failed some authorities advocated steps such as confinement beating other types torture make body uninhabitable by witches demons spirits belief that witches demons spirits are responsible abnormal behavior continued into th century Swiss alchemist astrologer physician Paracelsus on other hand rejected idea that abnormal behaviors were caused by witches demons spirits suggested that people s mind behaviors were influenced by movements moon stars This tradition still alive today Some people especially in developing countries some followers religious sects in developed countries continue believe that supernatural powers influence human behaviors In Western academia supernatural tradition has been largely replaced by biological psychological traditions Biological explanations edit In biological tradition psychological disorders are attributed biological causes in psychological tradition disorders are attributed faulty psychological development social context medical biological perspective holds belief that most all abnormal behavior can be attributed medical factor assuming all psychological disorders are diseases Greek physician Hippocrates considered be father Western medicine played major role in biological tradition Hippocrates his associates wrote Hippocratic Corpus between BC in which they suggested that abnormal behaviors can be treated like any other disease Hippocrates viewed brain as seat consciousness emotion intelligence wisdom believed that disorders involving these functions would logically be located in brain These ideas Hippocrates his associates were later adopted by Galen Roman physician Galen extended these ideas developed strong influential school thought within biological tradition that extended well into th century Medical Kendra Cherry states medical approach abnormal psychology focuses on biological causes on mental illness This perspective emphasizes understanding underlying cause disorders which might include genetic inheritance related physical disorders infections chemical imbalances Medical treatments are often pharmacological in nature although medication often used in conjunction with some other type psychotherapy Psychological explanations edit According Sigmund Freud s structural model Id Ego Superego are three theoretical constructs that define way an individual interacts with external world as well as responding internal forces Id represents instinctual drives an individual that remain unconscious superego represents person s conscience internalization societal norms morality finally ego serves realistically integrate drives id with prohibitions super ego Lack development in Superego an incoherently developed Superego within an individual will result in thoughts actions that are irrational abnormal contrary norms beliefs society Irrational beliefs edit Irrational beliefs that are driven by unconscious fears can result in abnormal behavior Rational emotive therapy helps drive irrational maladaptive beliefs out one s mind Sociocultural influences edit term sociocultural refers various circles influence on individual ranging from close friends family institutions policies country world as whole Discriminations whether based on social class income race ethnicity gender can influence development abnormal behaviour Multiple causality edit number different theoretical perspectives in field psychological abnormality has made it difficult properly explain psychopathology attempt explain all mental disorders with same theory leads reductionism explaining disorder other complex phenomena using only single idea perspective Most mental disorders are composed several factors which one must take into account several theoretical perspectives attempting diagnose explain particular behavioral abnormality mental disorder Explaining mental disorders with combination theoretical perspectives known as multiple causality diathesis stress model emphasizes importance applying multiple causality psychopathology by stressing that disorders are caused by both precipitating causes predisposing causes precipitating cause an immediate trigger that instigates person s action behavior predisposing cause an underlying factor that interacts with immediate factors result in disorder Both causes play key role in development psychological disorder example high neuroticism antedates most types psychopathology Recent concepts abnormality edit Statistical abnormality certain behavior characteristic relevant low percentage population However this does not necessarily mean that such individuals are suffering from mental illness example statistical abnormalities such as extreme wealth attractiveness Psychometric abnormality Psychometric abnormality implicates abnormality as deviation from statistically determined norm such as population average IQ In this case an IQ score less than about may define someone as having learning disability suggests they will have some difficulties coping with life However problems associated with low IQ differ widely across individuals depending on life circumstances So even an individual defined as psycho metrically abnormal this tells us little about actual condition problems Furthermore if one takes other end IQ spectrum deviation points above mean generally not considered be abnormal indicate presence mental health problems Deviant behavior this not always sign mental illness as mental illness can occur without deviant behavior such behavior may occur in absence mental illness Combinations including distress dysfunction distorted psychological processes inappropriate responses in given situations causing risking harm oneself Approaches edit Somatogenic abnormality seen as result biological disorders in brain This approach has led development radical biological treatments e g lobotomy Psychogenic abnormality caused by psychological problems Psychoanalytic Freud Cathartic Hypnotic Humanistic Psychology Carl Rogers Abraham Maslow treatments were all derived from this paradigm This approach has as well led some esoteric treatments Franz Mesmer used place his patients in darkened room with music playing then enter it wearing flamboyant outfit poke infected body areas with stick Classification edit DSM edit This section needs additional citations verification Please help improve this article by adding

psychology psychiatry reference book in North America Diagnostic Statistical Manual American Psychiatric Association current version book known as DSM It lists set disorders provides detailed descriptions on constitutes disorder such as major depressive disorder anxiety disorder It also gives general descriptions frequently disorder occurs in general population whether it more common in males females other such facts DSM identifies three key elements that must be present constitute mental disorder These elements include Symptoms that involve disturbances in behavior thoughts emotions Symptoms associated with personal distress impairment Symptoms that stem from internal dysfunctions i e specifically having biological psychological roots diagnostic process uses five dimensions each which identified as an axis ascertain symptoms overall functioning individual It important note that DSM no longer uses this axis system These axes are as follows Axis Clinical disorders which would include major mental learning disorders These disorders make up generally acknowledged as disorder including major depressive disorder generalized anxiety disorder schizophrenia substance dependence be given diagnosis disorder in this axis patient must meet criteria particular disorder which presented in DSM in that particular disorders section Disorders in this axis are particular importance they are likely have an effect on individual in many other axes In fact first axes are highly related This axis similar would be considered an illness disease in general medicine Axis II Personality Disorders decrease use intellect disorder This very broad axis which contains disorders relating individual functions with world around him herself This axis provides way coding long lasting maladaptive personality characteristics that could have factor in expression development disorder on Axis although this not always case Disorders in this axis include disorders such as antisocial personality disorder histrionic personality disorder paranoid personality disorder Mental retardation also coded in this axis although most other learning disabilities are coded in Axis This Axis an example Axes all interact with one another help give an overall diagnosis an individual Axis III General medical conditions Physical disorders conditions listed here are ones that could potentially be relevant managing understanding case Axis III often used together with an Axis diagnosis give better rounded explanation particular disorder An example this can be seen in relationship between major depressive disorder unremitting pain caused from chronic medical problem This category could also include use drugs alcohols as these are often symptoms disorder themselves such as substance dependence major depressive disorder Due nature Axis III it often recommended that patient visit medical doctor he she being assessed in order determine if problem could potentially require medical intervention such as surgery first axes are used multiple diagnosis are often found which actually encouraged by DSM Axis IV Psychosocial environmental problems which would contribute disorder Axis IV used inspect broader aspects person s situation This axis will examine social environmental factors that could affect person s diagnosis Stressors are main focus this axis particular attention paid stressors that have been present in past year however it not requirement that stressor had form continued in past year Due large number potential stressors in an individual s life therapists often find such stressors via checklist approach which encouraged by DSM An example checklist approach would be examine individual s family life economic situation occupation potential legal problems so on It crucial that patient honest in this section as environmental factors can have huge impact on patient especially in certain schools therapy such as cognitive approach Axis V Global assessment functioning often referred as GAF Children s Global Assessment Scale children teenagers under age Axis V score given patient which designed indicate well individual handling situation at current time GAF based on point scale which examiner will use give patient score Scores can range from depending on score on GAF examiner will decide best course action patient According manual scores higher than indicate satisfactory mental health good overall functioning minimal transient symptoms impairment scores between indicate mild symptoms impairment while scores between indicate moderate symptoms social vocational problems scores below severe impairment symptoms As GAF scores are final Axis DSM information present in previous axes are crucial determining an accurate score ICD edit major international nosologic system classification mental disorders can be found in most recent version International Classification Diseases th revision ICD ICD has been used by World Health Organization

professionals prefer combine two three perspectives together in order get significant information better treatments Behavioral perspective focus on observable behaviors Medical perspective focus on biological causes on mental illness Cognitive perspective focus on internal thoughts perceptions reasoning contribute psychological disorders Cause edit Genetics edit Investigated through family studies mainly monozygotic identical dizygotic fraternal twins often in context adoption Monozygotic twins should be more likely than dizygotic twins have same disorder they share genetic material whereas dizygotic twins share only many disorders this exactly research shows But given that monozygotic twins share genetic material it may be expected them have same disorders time but in fact they have same disorders only about time These studies allow calculation heritability coefficient Biological causal factors edit Neurotransmitter imbalances neurotransmitters like norepinephrine dopamine serotonin GABA Gamma aminobutyric acid hormonal imbalances in brain citation needed Genetic vulnerabilities Constitutional liabilities physical handicaps temperament Brain dysfunction neural plasticity Physical deprivation disruption deprivation basic physiological needs Socio cultural factors edit Effects urban rural dwelling gender minority status on state mind Generalizations about cultural practices beliefs may fail capture diversity that exists within across cultural groups so we must be extremely careful not stereotype individuals any cultural group Systemic factors edit Family systems Negatively Expressed Emotion playing part in schizophrenic relapse anorexia nervosa Biopsychosocial factors edit Illness dependent on stress triggers Therapies edit Psychoanalysis Freud Psychoanalytic theory heavily based on theory neurologist Sigmund Freud These ideas often represented repressed emotions memories from patient s childhood According psychoanalytic theory these repressions cause disturbances that people experience in daily lives by finding source these disturbances one should be able eliminate disturbance itself This accomplished by variety methods with some popular ones being free association hypnosis insight goal these methods induce catharsis emotional release in patient which should indicate that source problem has been tapped it can then be helped Freud s psychosexual stages also played key role in this form therapy as he would often believe that problems patient was experiencing were due them becoming stuck fixated in particular stage Dreams also played major role in this form therapy as Freud viewed dreams as way gain insight into unconscious mind Patients were often asked keep dream journals record dreams bring in discussion during next therapy session are many potential problems associated with this style therapy including resistance repressed memory feeling negative transference onto therapist Psychoanalysis was carried on by many after Freud including his daughter Ana Freud Jacques Lacan These many others have gone on elaborate on Freud s original theory add own take on defense mechanisms dream analysis While psychoanalysis has fallen out favor more modern forms therapy it still used by some clinical psychologists varying degrees Behavioral therapy Wolpe Behavior therapy relies on principles behaviorism such as involving classical operant conditioning Behaviorism arose in early th century due work psychologists such as James Watson B F Skinner Behaviorism states that all behaviors humans do stimulus reinforcement While this reinforcement normally good behavior it can also occur maladaptive behavior In this therapeutic view patients maladaptive behavior has been reinforced which will cause maladaptive behavior be repeated goal therapy reinforce less maladaptive behaviors so that with time these adaptive behaviors will become primary ones in patient Humanistic therapy Rogers Humanistic therapy aims achieve self actualization Carl Rogers In this style therapy therapist will focus on patient themselves as opposed problem which patient afflicted with overall goal this therapy that by treating patient as human instead client will help get source problem hopefully resolve problem in an effective manner Humanistic therapy has been on rise in recent years has been associated with numerous positive benefits It considered be one core elements needed therapeutic effectiveness significant contributor not only well being patient but society as whole Some say that all therapeutic approaches today draw from humanistic approach in some regard that humanistic therapy best way treat patient Humanistic therapy can be used on people all ages however it very popular among children in its variant known as play therapy Children are often sent therapy due outburst that they have in school home setting theory that by treating child in setting that similar area that they are having disruptive behavior child will be more likely learn from therapy have an effective outcome In play therapy clinicians will play with client usually with toys tea party Playing typical behavior child therefore playing with therapist will come as natural response child In playing together clinician will ask patient questions but due setting questions no longer seem intrusive therapeutic more like normal conversation This should help patient realizes issues they have confess them therapist with less difficulty than they may experience in traditional counselling setting Cognitive behavioural therapy Ellis Beck Cognitive behavioural therapy aims influence thought cognition Beck This form therapy relies on not only components behavioral therapy as mentioned before but also elements cognitive psychology This relies on not only clients behavioral problems that could have arisen from conditioning but also negative schemas distorted perceptions world around them These negative schemas may be causing distress in life patient example schemas may be giving them unrealistic expectations well they should perform at job they should look physically these expectations are not met it will often result in maladaptive behaviors such as depression obsessive compulsions anxiety With cognitive behavior therapy goal change schemas that are causing stress in persons life hopefully replace them with more realistic ones Once negative schemas have been replaced it will hopefully cause remission patients symptoms CBT considered particularly effective in treatment depression has even been used lately in group settings It felt that using CBT in group setting aids in giving its members sense support decreasing likelihood them dropping out therapy before treatment has had time work properly CBT has been found be an effective treatments many patients even those do not have diseases disorders typically thought as psychiatric ones example patients with disease multiple sclerosis have found lot help using CBT treatment often helps patients cope with disorder they have they can adapt new lives without developing new problems such as depression negative schemas about themselves According RAND therapies are difficult provide all patients in need lack funding understanding symptoms provides major roadblock that not easily avoided Individual symptoms responses treatments vary creating
