game be played under these rules was NFL Championship Game between Baltimore Colts New York Giants Greatest Game Ever Played In NFL adopted sudden death overtime regular season preseason games If score tied after regulation time has expired one additional period played Until season period was minutes in all games Since it minutes exhibition regular season games captains meet with officials coin toss then one side kicks off other as at start game Under original regular season format used through whoever scored first during extra period won game Additionally during regular season games fourth quarter timing rules were in effect throughout period including two minute warning if necessary In regular season if overtime period completed without either side scoring game ends in tie cannot be tie in playoffs teams would switch ends field start multiple minute overtime periods until one side scored all clock rules were as if game had started over Therefore if game was still tied with two minutes go in second fourth overtime would be two minute warning but not during first overtime period as in regular season If it was still tied at end second overtime team that lost overtime

Chiefs last ever game at Municipal Stadium Miami kicker Garo Yepremian kicked yard field goal at second overtime longest game in all modern American professional football minutes seconds in United

games have ended in tie since then most recent was on September Arizona Cardinals Detroit Lions fought all tie th game end that way since Scoreless ties were common in early years NFL but none has happened since in part due innovations added by Hugh Shorty Ray encourage more scoring In March NFL owners voted amend overtime rules postseason games changes were extended regular season in changes preserved sudden death with one notable exception if team that receives opening kickoff scores field goal team that initially kicked off gets one possession tie win game any other score on opening possession ends game immediately In postseason games if both teams are still tied after first overtime procedure repeated until winner declared in regular season games if score tied after minutes game ends No postseason game went into overtime so first overtime game played after implementation this rule came in wild card round in Incidentally this was also shortest overtime in NFL history Pittsburgh Steelers kicker Shaun Suisham kicked off ball went out back end zone resulting in touchback no time off clock Tim Tebow then with Denver Broncos threw an yard touchdown pass on first play Demaryius Thomas give Broncos win in only seconds first time first possession field goal rule was enforced occurred on September first week season in game between Minnesota Vikings Jacksonville Jaguars Minnesota s Blair Walsh kicked yard field goal on Vikings first drive Jacksonville regained possession they failed gain first down losing possession game on failed fourth down conversion first overtime in which both teams scored occurred on November in game between Houston Texans Jacksonville Jaguars Texans won first overtime game that ended in tie after both teams scored in overtime occurred on November Minnesota Vikings Green Bay Packers played all tie On February Super Bowl went into overtime first time ever with New England Patriots defeating Atlanta Falcons Patriots scored touchdown on initial possession so Falcons never received ball in overtime Other professional football leagues edit Arena Football League NFL Europe used variant in which each team guaranteed one possession Whoever leading after one possession wins game if teams remain tied after one possession game goes sudden death This procedure was used by United Football League in its inaugural season This includes both games all semifinals series All overtime periods thereafter are true sudden death periods short lived World Football League its inaugural season same year NFL established sudden death in regular season used fifteen minute quarter extra time divided into two halves It was not sudden death New York Pro Football League s era league that eventually had several its teams join NFL used replay settle ties in its playoff tournament replay was used in tournament decide championship between Buffalo Prospects Rochester Jeffersons teams had played tie on Thanksgiving Buffalo won replay win championship College high school Canadian football edit In college since season high school football as well as Canadian Football League since season short lived Alliance American Football an overtime procedure used determine winner This method sometimes referred as Kansas Playoff Kansas Plan its origins high school football in that state brief summary rules coin toss determines which side shall attempt score first at which end zone scores shall be attempted Each team in turn will receive one possession similar innings in baseball starting with first from fixed point on opponent s side field In college football as season first possession overtime begins at opponent s yard line if necessary next three possessions each team also start at this same point After four overtime procedures all possessions thereafter will be two point conversion attempt taken from yard line standard starting point that play under NCAA rules Before season opponent s was used as starting point all overtime procedures Under standard high school football rules possession begins at yard line However high school rulebook only recommends overtime procedure allows state associations use own yard lines are variously used AAF also used yard line as its starting point In CFL single point can be scored on punt possession begins at yard line play clock runs as normal no game clock all play otherwise untimed team s possession ends it defense scores misses field goal turns over ball either on downs by defense otherwise gaining possession In high school college CFL field goal can be kicked at any time Thus if first team fails score opponent already usually in field goal range can end game by kicking one in CFL as previously noted one can do same with single In AAF no field goals were allowed at any time during playoff As usual touchdown by offense followed by try one two points In NCAA football starting with triple overtime teams must attempt two point conversion after touchdown from all overtime procedures beyond fourth consist two point conversion attempts are scored as such Since CFL teams must also attempt two point conversion after any touchdown in overtime AAF required two point conversions after any touchdown In college football defense may score touchdown on play on which it gains possession by turnover such play will satisfy condition each team having possession will therefore end game In high school football defense generally not allowed score if it gains possession although Oregon School Activities Association adopted college rule experimentally in two main high school governing bodies in Texas University Interscholastic League Texas Association Private Parochial Schools use NCAA football rules as did Massachusetts through season after which it adopted standard high school rules If scoring not allowed turnover play does not end with score regardless eventual position ball at end play team assumes offense will begin procedure from specified position on field Each team receives one charged time out per offensive defensive series except in CFL If score remains tied at end first overtime period procedure repeated team with second possession in one overtime will have first possession in next overtime In CFL limit two overtime procedures in regular season games if scores are still level game tie but in playoff games overtime periods are continued until winner determined AAF did same except that regular season games ended after only one overtime procedure regardless score AAF folded before it ever played any playoff games In American college high school football overtime periods are continued until winner determined All points scored in overtime count as if they were scored in regulation This in contrast analogous penalty shootout used in other sports shootout points are counted separately only one point awarded winner however this procedure like extra innings in baseball On two occasions just two plays were required determine an overtime winner in an NCAA football game on September Louisville defeated Florida State on September Georgia Tech defeated Vanderbilt It possible college game end after single play in overtime if team on defense secures turnover returns it touchdown on September Ohio defeated Pittsburgh on an yard interception return by Dion Byrum on third play overtime It also possible defense get safety on first play overtime which would also end game but this would require offense lose yards on play which extremely unlikely such scenario attested in regular play from scrimmage in college football but never in an overtime period As Tennessee Volunteers have competed in most overtime college football games totalling development this Kansas System was implemented in original Kansas System had each team start on yard line Throughout state that first year seventy games went into overtime with one game requiring five overtime periods determine winner After system was reviewed positively by majority state s coaches administrators Kansas State High School Activities Association leadership presented system National Federation State High School Associations approved giving state associations option using overtime system two years Two years later overtime system became permanent option state associations use Another type overtime system was once used by California Interscholastic Federation Known as California tiebreaker it was used in high school football from through s s California tiebreaker starts with ball placed at yard line teams run four plays each coin toss decides gets go first alternating possession at spot ball after every play If no one manages score field goals aren t allowed then team that s in its opponents territory at conclusion eight plays awarded one point declared winner California tiebreaker was finally phased out it was replaced by Kansas tiebreaker XFL edit short lived XFL used modified Kansas Playoff series would start on yard line have four downs score However if first team play overtime scored touchdown in less than four downs second team would have score in just as many plays instance if first team scored touchdown on three downs second team would only have three downs score touchdown Neither team could kick field goal until fourth down rule imposed prevent teams from turning overtime period into equivalent penalty shootout Although such scenario never happened in league s short life XFL rules did not explain would happen should turnover occur set four downs end prematurely Rather than coin toss winner opening scramble at beginning game also got choose go first second in overtime revival XFL plans on using five round shootout teams will alternate one play at time attempting score one point conversion on single play from five yard line with each team s respective offense defense occupying opposite sides field simultaneously Any interception defensive fumble recovery would score single point defense In postseason however multiple rounds will be played until one team succeeds which wins game Basketball edit In basketball if score tied at end regulation play teams play multiple five minute overtime periods until winner decided In levels below collegiate Olympic play an overtime period half length standard quarter i e four minutes high school varsity x originally FIBA formalized version halfcourt three on three game
