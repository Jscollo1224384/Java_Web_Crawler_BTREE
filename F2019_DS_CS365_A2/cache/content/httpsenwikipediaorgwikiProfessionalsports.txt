professionalism edit Professional athleticism has been traditional object criticism by proponents amateurist philosophy sport according which central ethos sport competition performed its own sake pure enjoyment rather than as means earning living Examples amateurist philosophy include muscular Christianity movement that informed promotion sports in English public school system Olympism advocated by Pierre de Coubertin force behind revival modern Olympic Games tension between two sporting practices ideals dates from inception modern organized sports in th century high political financial stakes involved in sport have ensured that this tension has remained strong Professional sporting organizations have often developed as rebel organizations in relation established national international federation example schism which created code rugby league Arguments against amateurism often appeal argument that amateurism in sport favors classes can afford not be paid play thus covert form prejudice against lower classes Another argument that amateur players are often de facto professionals retain amateur status by earning allowances instead salaries example all Eastern bloc

instance highest paid team in professional baseball New York Yankees Tiger Woods highest paid athlete totaling including his endorsement income which massively exceeds he earns from tournament golf

current salary Samuel Eto o world s second highest earning athlete highest paid footballer in world raking in million over million year excluding off field earnings top ten tennis players make about million year on average Much growth in income sports athletes has come from broadcasting rights example most recent television contract NFL valued at nearly US billion per year Women in U S on other hand make much less example as WNBA enforced maximum salary US star players coaches could earn double that This largely driven by fact that American viewing audience has far less interest in women s professional sport compared men s average in person attendance television viewership are both far higher NBA compared WNBA According investopedia com male star like Kobe Bryant LeBron James can individually earn salary larger than every player in WNBA combined Outside highest leagues however money professional athletes can earn drops dramatically as fan bases are generally smaller television revenues are nonexistent instance while National Football League s teams can afford pay players millions dollars each year still maintain significant profit second highest American football league in United States United Football League consistently struggled pay its bills has continually lost money despite allotting its players only US year television networks made league pay television airtime instead paying league making league s business model unworkable In United States Canada most lower end professional leagues run themselves as affiliated farm teams effectively agreeing develop younger players eventual play in major leagues in exchange subsidizing those players salaries this known as minor league system most prevalent in professional baseball professional ice hockey Otherwise league may be required classify itself as semi professional in other words able pay players small sum but not enough cover player s basic costs living Many professional athletes experience financial difficulties soon after retiring due combination bad investments careless spending lack non athletic skills wear tear career in professional sport can cause physical mental side effects such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy condition that has seen massive rise in public awareness in s that can harm former professional athlete s employability In United States some these problems are mitigated by fact that college sports system ensures most professional athletes receive college education with no student debt legacy that provides them with career path after sports career ends
