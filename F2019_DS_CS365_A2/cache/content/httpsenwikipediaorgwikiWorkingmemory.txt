context theories that likened mind computer In Atkinson Shiffrin used term describe short term store we now call working memory was formerly referred variously as short term store short term memory primary memory immediate memory operant memory provisional memory Short term memory ability remember information over brief period in order seconds Most theorists today use concept working memory replace include older concept short term memory marking stronger emphasis on notion manipulating information rather than mere maintenance earliest mention experiments on neural basis working memory can be traced back more than years ago Hitzig Ferrier described ablation experiments prefrontal cortex PFC they concluded that frontal cortex was important cognitive rather than sensory processes In Carlyle Jacobsen colleagues were first show deleterious effect prefrontal ablation on delayed response Theories edit Numerous models have been proposed working memory functions both anatomically cognitively those two that have been most influential are summarized below multicomponent model edit Main article Baddeley s model working memory Baddeley Hitch s model working memory In Baddeley Hitch introduced multicomponent model working memory theory proposed model containing three components central executive phonological loop visuospatial sketchpad with central executive functioning as control center sorts directing info between phonological visuospatial components central executive responsible inter alia directing attention relevant information suppressing irrelevant information inappropriate actions coordinating cognitive processes more than one task simultaneously performed central executive responsible supervising integration information coordinating slave systems that are responsible short term maintenance information One slave system phonological loop PL stores phonological information that sound language prevents its decay by continuously refreshing it in rehearsal loop It can example maintain seven digit telephone number as long as one repeats number oneself again again other slave system visuospatial sketchpad stores visual spatial information It can be used example constructing manipulating visual images representing mental maps sketchpad can be further broken down into visual subsystem dealing with such phenomena as shape colour texture spatial subsystem dealing with location In Baddeley extended model by adding fourth component episodic buffer which holds representations that integrate phonological visual spatial information possibly information not covered by slave systems e g semantic information musical information episodic buffer also link between working memory long term memory component episodic it assumed bind information into unitary episodic representation episodic buffer resembles Tulving s concept episodic memory but it differs in that episodic buffer temporary store Working memory as part long term memory edit Central Executive Long term Memory Central Executive Working Memory retrieving memory from unlimited Long term Memory Anders Ericsson Walter Kintsch have introduced notion long term working memory which they define as set retrieval structures in long term memory that enable seamless access information relevant everyday tasks In this way parts long term memory effectively function as working memory In similar vein Cowan does not regard working memory as separate system from long term memory Representations in working memory are subset representations in long term memory Working memory organized into two embedded levels first consists long term memory representations that are activated can be many these theoretically no limit activation representations in long term memory second level called focus attention focus regarded as having limited capacity holds up four activated representations Oberauer has extended Cowan s model by adding third component more narrow focus attention that holds only one chunk at time one element focus embedded in four element focus serves select single chunk processing example four digits can be held in mind at same time in Cowan s focus attention individual wishes perform process on each these digits example adding number two each digit separate processing required each digit since most individuals cannot perform several mathematical processes in parallel Oberauer s attentional component selects one digits processing then shifts attentional focus next digit continuing until all digits have been processed Capacity edit Working memory capacity represents personal skill have good command individual s mind Working memory generally considered have limited capacity An early quantification capacity limit associated with short term memory was magical number seven suggested by Miller in He claimed that information processing capacity young adults around seven elements which he called chunks regardless whether elements are digits letters words other units Later research revealed this number depends on category chunks used e g span may be around seven digits six letters five words even on features chunks within category instance span lower long than short words In general memory span verbal contents digits letters words etc depends on phonological complexity content i e number phonemes number syllables on lexical status contents whether contents are words known person not Several other factors affect person s measured span therefore it difficult pin down capacity short term working memory number chunks Nonetheless Cowan proposed that working memory has capacity about four chunks in young adults fewer in children old adults Whereas most adults can repeat about seven digits in correct order some individuals have shown impressive enlargements digit span up digits This feat possible by extensive training on an encoding strategy by which digits in list are grouped usually in groups three five these groups are encoded as single unit chunk this succeed participants must be able recognize groups as some known string digits One person studied by Ericsson his colleagues example used an extensive knowledge racing times from history sports in process coding chunks several such chunks could then be combined into higher order chunk forming hierarchy chunks In this way only some chunks at highest level hierarchy must be retained in working memory retrieval chunks are unpacked That chunks in working memory act as retrieval cues that point digits they contain Practicing memory skills such as these does not expand working memory capacity proper it capacity transfer retrieve information from long term memory that improved according Ericsson Kintsch see also Gobet Simon Measures correlates edit Working memory capacity can be tested by variety tasks commonly used measure dual task paradigm combining memory span measure with concurrent processing task sometimes referred as complex span Daneman Carpenter invented first version this kind task reading span in Subjects read number sentences usually between two six tried remember last word each sentence At end list sentences they repeated back words in correct order Other tasks that do not have this dual task nature have also been shown be good measures working memory capacity Whereas Daneman Carpenter believed that combination storage maintenance processing needed measure working memory capacity we know now that capacity working memory can be measured with short term memory tasks that have no additional processing component Conversely working memory capacity can also be measured with certain processing tasks that don t involve maintenance information question features task must have qualify as good measure working memory capacity topic ongoing research Measures working memory capacity are strongly related performance in other complex cognitive tasks such as reading comprehension problem solving with measures intelligence quotient Some researchers have argued that working memory capacity reflects efficiency executive functions most notably ability maintain multiple task relevant representations in face distracting irrelevant information that such tasks seem reflect individual differences in ability focus maintain attention particularly other events are serving capture attention Both working memory executive functions rely strongly though not exclusively on frontal brain areas Other researchers have argued that capacity working memory better characterized as ability mentally form relations between elements grasp relations in given information This idea has been advanced among others by Graeme Halford illustrated it by our limited ability understand statistical interactions between variables These authors asked people compare written statements about relations between several variables graphs illustrating same different relation as in following sentence If cake from France then it has more sugar if it made with chocolate than if it made with cream but if cake from Italy then it has more sugar if it made with cream than if it made chocolate This statement describes relation between three variables country ingredient amount sugar which maximum most individuals can understand capacity limit apparent here obviously not memory limit all relevant information can be seen continuously but limit many relationships are discerned simultaneously Experimental studies working memory capacity edit are several hypotheses about nature capacity limit One that limited pool cognitive resources needed keep representations active thereby available processing carrying out processes Another hypothesis that memory traces in working memory decay within few seconds unless refreshed through rehearsal speed rehearsal limited we can maintain only limited amount information Yet another idea that representations held in working memory interfere with each other Decay theories edit assumption that contents short term working memory decay over time unless decay prevented by rehearsal goes back early days experimental research on short term memory It also an important assumption in multi component theory working memory most elaborate decay based theory working memory date time based resource sharing model This theory assumes that representations in working memory decay unless they are refreshed Refreshing them requires an attentional mechanism that also needed any concurrent processing task are small time intervals in which processing task does not require attention this time can be used refresh memory traces theory therefore predicts that amount forgetting depends on temporal density attentional demands processing task this density called cognitive load cognitive load depends on two variables rate at which processing task requires individual steps be carried out duration each step example if processing task consists adding digits then having add another digit every half second places higher cognitive load on system than having add another digit every two seconds In series experiments Barrouillet colleagues have shown that memory lists letters depends neither on number processing steps nor total time processing but on cognitive load Resource theories edit Resource theories assume that capacity working memory limited resource that must be shared between all representations that need be maintained in working memory simultaneously Some resource theorists also assume that maintenance concurrent processing share same resource this can explain maintenance typically impaired by concurrent processing demand Resource theories have been very successful in explaining data from tests working memory simple visual features such as colors orientations bars An ongoing debate whether resource continuous quantity that can be subdivided among any number items in working memory whether it consists small number discrete slots each which can be assigned one memory item so that only limited number about items can be maintained in working memory at all Interference theories edit Several forms interference have been discussed by theorists One oldest ideas that new items simply replace older ones in working memory Another form interference retrieval competition example task remember list words in order we need start recall with first word While trying retrieve first word second word which represented in proximity accidentally retrieved as well two compete being recalled Errors in serial recall tasks are often confusions neighboring items on memory list so called transpositions showing that retrieval competition plays role in limiting our ability recall lists in order probably also in other working memory tasks third form interference distortion representations by superposition multiple representations are added on top each other each them blurred by presence all others fourth form interference assumed by some authors feature overwriting idea that each word digit other item in working memory represented as bundle features two items share some features one them steals features from other more items are held in working memory more features overlap more each them will be degraded by loss some features Limitations edit None these hypotheses can explain experimental data entirely resource hypothesis example was meant explain trade off between maintenance processing more information must be maintained in working memory slower more error prone concurrent processes become with higher demand on concurrent processing memory suffers This trade off has been investigated by tasks like reading span task described above It has been found that amount trade off depends on similarity information be remembered information be processed example remembering numbers while processing spatial information remembering spatial information while processing numbers impair each other much less than material same kind must be remembered processed Also remembering words processing digits remembering digits processing words easier than remembering processing materials same category These findings are also difficult explain decay hypothesis decay memory representations should depend only on long processing task delays rehearsal recall not on content processing task further problem decay hypothesis comes from experiments in which recall list letters was delayed either by instructing participants recall at slower pace by instructing them say an irrelevant word once three times in between recall each letter Delaying recall had virtually no effect on recall accuracy interference theory seems fare best with explaining similarity between memory contents contents concurrent processing tasks affects much they impair each other More similar materials are more likely be confused leading retrieval competition Development edit capacity working memory increases gradually over childhood declines gradually in old age Childhood edit Main article Neo Piagetian theories cognitive development Measures performance on tests working memory increase continuously between early childhood adolescence while structure correlations between different tests remains largely constant Starting with work in Neo Piagetian tradition theorists have argued that growth working memory capacity major driving force cognitive development This hypothesis has received substantial empirical support from studies showing that capacity working memory strong predictor cognitive abilities in childhood Particularly strong evidence role working memory development comes from longitudinal study showing that working memory capacity at one age predicts reasoning ability at later age Studies in Neo Piagetian tradition have added this picture by analyzing complexity cognitive tasks in terms number items relations that have be considered simultaneously solution Across broad range tasks children manage task versions same level complexity at about same age consistent with view that working memory capacity limits complexity they can handle at given age Although neuroscience studies support notion that children rely on prefrontal cortex performing various working memory tasks an fMRI meta analysis on children compared adults performing n back task revealed lack consistent prefrontal cortex activation in children while posterior regions including insular cortex cerebellum remain intact Aging edit Working memory among cognitive functions most sensitive decline in old age Several explanations have been offered this decline in psychology One processing speed theory cognitive aging by Tim Salthouse Drawing on finding general slowing cognitive processes as people grow older Salthouse argues that slower processing leaves more time working memory contents decay thus reducing effective capacity However decline working memory capacity cannot be entirely attributed slowing capacity declines more in old age than speed Another proposal inhibition hypothesis advanced by Lynn Hasher Rose Zacks This theory assumes general deficit in old age in ability inhibit irrelevant no longer relevant information Therefore working memory tends be cluttered with irrelevant contents that reduce effective capacity relevant content assumption an inhibition deficit in old age has received much empirical support but so far it not clear whether decline in inhibitory ability fully explains decline working memory capacity An explanation on neural level decline working memory other cognitive functions in old age has been proposed by West She argued that working memory depends large degree on pre frontal cortex which deteriorates more than other brain regions as we grow old Age related decline in working memory can be briefly reversed using low intensity transcranial stimulation synchronizing rhythms in bilateral frontal left temporal lobe areas Training edit Further information Working memory training Neurobiological effects physical exercise Cognitive control memory Torkel Klingberg was first investigate whether intensive training working memory has beneficial effects on other cognitive functions His pioneering study suggested that working memory can be improved by training in ADHD patients through computerized programs This study has found that period working memory training increases range cognitive abilities increases IQ test scores Another study same group has shown that after training measured brain activity related working memory increased in prefrontal cortex an area that many researchers have associated with working memory functions It has been shown in one study that working memory training increases density prefrontal parietal dopamine receptors specifically DRD in test persons However subsequent work with same training program has failed replicate beneficial effects training on cognitive performance meta analytic summary research with Klingberg s training program up shows that this training has at best negligible effect on tests intelligence attention In another influential study training with working memory task dual n back task has improved performance on fluid intelligence test in healthy young adults improvement fluid intelligence by training with n back task was replicated in but two studies published in failed reproduce effect combined evidence from about experimental studies on effectiveness working memory training has been evaluated by several meta analyses authors these meta analyses disagree in conclusions as whether not working memory training improves intelligence Yet these meta analyses agree in estimate size effect working memory training If such an effect it likely be small In brain edit Neural mechanisms maintaining information edit first insights into neuronal neurotransmitter basis working memory came from animal research work Jacobsen Fulton in s first showed that lesions PFC impaired spatial working memory performance in monkeys later work Joaquin Fuster recorded electrical activity neurons in PFC monkeys while they were doing delayed matching task In that task monkey sees experimenter places bit food under one two identical looking cups shutter then lowered variable delay period screening off cups from monkey s view After delay shutter opens monkey allowed retrieve food from under cups Successful retrieval in first attempt something animal can achieve after some training on task requires holding location food in memory over delay period Fuster found neurons in PFC that fired mostly during delay period suggesting that they were involved in representing food location while it was invisible Later research has shown similar delay active neurons also in posterior parietal cortex thalamus caudate globus pallidus work Goldman Rakic others showed that principal sulcal dorsolateral PFC interconnects with all these brain regions that neuronal microcircuits within PFC are able maintain information in working memory through recurrent excitatory glutamate networks pyramidal cells that continue fire throughout delay period These circuits are tuned by lateral inhibition from GABAergic interneurons neuromodulatory arousal systems markedly alter PFC working memory function example either little much dopamine norepinephrine impairs PFC network firing working memory performance research described above on persistent firing certain neurons in delay period working memory tasks shows that brain has mechanism keeping representations active without external input Keeping representations active however not enough if task demands maintaining more than one chunk information In addition components features each chunk must be bound together prevent them from being mixed up example if red triangle green square must be remembered at same time one must make sure that red bound triangle green bound square One way establishing such bindings by having neurons that represent features same chunk fire in synchrony those that represent features belonging different chunks fire out sync In example neurons representing redness would fire in synchrony with neurons representing triangular shape but out sync with those representing square shape So far no direct evidence that working memory uses this binding mechanism other mechanisms have been proposed as well It has been speculated that synchronous firing neurons involved in working memory oscillate with frequencies in theta band Hz Indeed power theta frequency in EEG increases with working memory load oscillations in theta band measured over different parts skull become more coordinated person tries remember binding between two components information Localization in brain edit Localization brain functions in humans has become much easier with advent brain imaging methods PET fMRI This research has confirmed that areas in PFC are involved in working memory functions During s much debate has centered on different functions ventrolateral i e lower areas dorsolateral higher areas PFC human lesion study provides additional evidence role dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in working memory One view was that dorsolateral areas are responsible spatial working memory ventrolateral areas non spatial working memory Another view proposed functional distinction arguing that ventrolateral areas are mostly involved in pure maintenance information whereas dorsolateral areas are more involved in tasks requiring some processing memorized material debate not entirely resolved but most evidence supports functional distinction Brain imaging has also revealed that working memory functions are not limited PFC review numerous studies shows areas activation during working memory tasks scattered over large part cortex tendency spatial tasks recruit more right hemisphere areas verbal object working memory recruit more left hemisphere areas activation during verbal working memory tasks can be broken down into one component reflecting maintenance in left posterior parietal cortex component reflecting subvocal rehearsal in left frontal cortex Broca s area known be involved in speech production an emerging consensus that most working memory tasks recruit network PFC parietal areas study has shown that during working memory task connectivity between these areas increases Another study has demonstrated that these areas are necessary working memory not simply activated accidentally during working memory tasks by temporarily blocking them through transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS thereby producing an impairment in task performance current debate concerns function these brain areas PFC has been found be active in variety tasks that require executive functions This has led some researchers argue that role PFC in working memory in controlling attention selecting strategies manipulating information in working memory but not in maintenance information maintenance function attributed more posterior areas brain including parietal cortex Other authors interpret activity in parietal cortex as reflecting executive functions same area also activated in other tasks requiring attention but not memory meta analysis neuroimaging studies found left frontal cortex was involved in low task demand verbal working memory right frontal cortex spatial working memory Brodmann s areas BAs in superior frontal cortex was involved working memory must be continuously updated memory temporal order had be maintained Right Brodmann in ventral frontal cortex were involved more frequently with demand manipulation such as dual task requirements mental operations Brodmann in posterior parietal cortex was also involved in all types executive function Working memory has been suggested involve two processes with different neuroanatomical locations in frontal parietal lobes First selection operation that retrieves most relevant item second an updating operation that changes focus attention made upon it Updating attentional focus has been found involve transient activation in caudal superior frontal sulcus posterior parietal cortex while increasing demands on selection selectively changes activation in rostral superior frontal sulcus posterior cingulate precuneus Articulating differential function brain regions involved in working memory dependent on tasks able distinguish these functions Most brain imaging studies working memory have used recognition tasks such as delayed recognition one several stimuli n back task in which each new stimulus in long series must be compared one presented n steps back in series advantage recognition tasks that they require minimal movement just pressing one two keys making fixation head in scanner easier Experimental research research on individual differences in working memory however has used largely recall tasks e g reading span task see below It not clear degree recognition recall tasks reflect same processes same capacity limitations Brain imaging studies have been conducted with reading span task related tasks Increased activation during these tasks was found in PFC in several studies also in anterior cingulate cortex ACC People performing better on task showed larger increase activation in these areas activation was correlated more over time suggesting that neural activity in these two areas was better coordinated possibly due stronger connectivity Neural models edit One approach model neurophysiology functioning working memory prefrontal cortex basal ganglia working memory PBWM Effects stress on neurophysiology edit Working memory impaired by acute chronic psychological stress This phenomenon was first discovered in animal studies by Arnsten colleagues have shown that stress induced catecholamine release in PFC rapidly decreases PFC neuronal firing impairs working memory performance through feedforward intracellular signaling pathways Exposure chronic stress leads more profound working memory deficits additional architectural changes in PFC including dendritic atrophy spine loss which can be prevented by inhibition protein kinase C signaling fMRI research has extended this research humans confirms that reduced working memory caused by acute stress links reduced activation PFC stress increased levels catecholamines Imaging studies medical students undergoing stressful exams have also shown weakened PFC functional connectivity consistent with animal studies marked effects stress on PFC structure function may help explain stress can cause exacerbate mental illness more stress in one s life lower efficiency working memory in performing simple cognitive tasks Students performed exercises that reduced intrusion negative thoughts showed an increase in working memory capacity Mood states positive negative can have an influence on neurotransmitter dopamine which in turn can affect problem solving Effects alcohol on neurophysiology edit Alcohol abuse can result in brain damage which impairs working memory Alcohol has an effect on blood oxygen level dependent BOLD response BOLD response correlates increased blood oxygenation with brain activity which makes this response useful tool measuring neuronal activity BOLD response affects regions brain such as basal ganglia thalamus performing working memory task Adolescents start drinking at young age show decreased BOLD response in these brain regions Alcohol dependent young women in particular exhibit less BOLD response in parietal frontal cortices performing spatial working memory task Binge drinking specifically can also affect one s performance on working memory tasks particularly visual working memory Additionally seems be gender difference in regards alcohol affects working memory While women perform better on verbal working memory tasks after consuming alcohol compared men they appear perform worse on spatial working memory tasks as indicated by less brain activity Finally age seems be an additional factor Older adults are more susceptible than others effects alcohol on working memory Genetics edit Behavioral genetics edit Individual differences in working memory capacity are some extent heritable that about half variation between individuals related differences in genes genetic component variability working memory capacity largely shared with that fluid intelligence Attempts identify individual genes edit Little known about which genes are related functioning working memory Within theoretical framework multi component model one candidate gene has been proposed namely ROBO hypothetical phonological loop component working memory Role in academic achievement edit Working memory capacity correlated with learning outcomes in literacy numeracy Initial evidence this relation comes from correlation between working memory capacity reading comprehension as first observed by Daneman Carpenter confirmed in later meta analytic review several studies Subsequent work found that working memory performance in primary school children accurately predicted performance in mathematical problem solving One longitudinal study showed that child s working memory at years old better predictor academic success than IQ In large scale screening study one in ten children in mainstream classrooms were identified with working memory deficits majority them performed very poorly in academic achievements independent IQ Similarly working memory deficits have been identified in national curriculum low achievers as young as seven years age Without appropriate intervention these children lag behind peers recent study school age children with significant learning disabilities has shown that working memory capacity at baseline measurement but not IQ predicts learning outcomes two years later This suggests that working memory impairments are associated with low learning outcomes constitute high risk factor educational underachievement children In children with learning disabilities such as dyslexia ADHD developmental coordination disorder similar pattern evident Relation attention edit some evidence that optimal working memory performance links neural ability focus attention on task relevant information ignore distractions that practice related improvement in working memory due increasing these abilities One line research suggests link between working memory capacities person ability control orientation attention stimuli in environment Such control enables people attend information important current goals ignore goal irrelevant stimuli that tend capture attention due sensory saliency such as an ambulance siren direction attention according one s goals assumed rely on top down signals from pre frontal cortex PFC that biases processing in posterior cortical areas Capture attention by salient stimuli assumed be driven by bottom up signals from subcortical structures primary sensory cortices ability override bottom up capture attention differs between individuals this difference has been found correlate with performance in working memory test visual information Another study however found no correlation between ability override attentional capture measures more general working memory capacity Relationship with neural disorders edit An impairment working memory functioning normally seen in several neural disorders ADHD Several authors have proposed that symptoms ADHD arise from primary deficit in specific executive function EF domain such as working memory response inhibition more general weakness in executive control meta analytical review cites several studies that found significant lower group results ADHD in spatial verbal working memory tasks in several other EF tasks However authors concluded that EF weaknesses neither are necessary nor sufficient cause all cases ADHD Several neurotransmitters such as dopamine glutamate may be both involved in ADHD working memory Both are associated with frontal brain self direction self regulation but cause effect have not been confirmed so it unclear whether working memory dysfunction leads ADHD ADHD distractibility leads poor functionality working memory if some other connection Parkinson s disease Patients with Parkinson s show signs reduced verbal function working memory They wanted find if reduction due lack ability focus on relevant tasks low amount memory capacity Twenty one patients with Parkinson s were tested in comparison control group participants same age researchers found that both hypotheses were reason working memory function reduced which did not fully agree with hypothesis that it either one other Alzheimer s disease As Alzheimer s disease becomes more serious less working memory functions one study that focuses on neural connections fluidity working memory in mice brains Half mice were given an injection that similar Alzheimer s effects other half were not Then they were expected go through maze that task test working memory study help answer questions about Alzheimer s can deteriorate working memory ultimately obliterate memory functions Huntington s disease group researchers hosted study that researched function connectivity working memory over month longitudinal experiment It found that were certain places in brain most connectivity was decreased in pre Huntington diseased patients in comparison
