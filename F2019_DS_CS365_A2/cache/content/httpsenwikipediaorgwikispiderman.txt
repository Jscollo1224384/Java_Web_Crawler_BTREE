he has told that story so often he has become unsure whether not this true note Although at time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with boy Lee says he chose Spider Man he wanted character age as series progressed moreover felt name Spider Boy would have made character sound inferior other superheroes He also decided insert hyphen in name as he felt it looked similar Superman another superhero with red blue costume which starts with an S ends with man At that time Lee had get only consent Marvel publisher Martin Goodman character s approval In interview Lee described in

anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy which was renamed Amazing Fantasy that single issue cover dated August on sale June In particular Lee stated that fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy would be canceled after issue was only reason Goodman allowed him use Spider Man While this was indeed final issue its editorial page anticipated comic continuing that Spiderman sic will appear every month in Amazing Regardless Lee received Goodman s approval name Spider Man ordinary teen concept approached artist Jack Kirby As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in s in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds magic ring that granted him superhuman powers Lee Kirby immediately sat down story conference Theakston writes Lee afterward directed Kirby flesh out character draw some pages Steve Ditko would be inker note Kirby showed Lee first six pages Lee recalled hated way he was doing it Not that he did it badly it just wasn t character wanted it was heroic Lee turned Ditko developed visual style Lee found satisfactory Ditko recalled One first things did was work up costume vital visual part character had know he looked before did any breakdowns example clinging power so he wouldn t have hard shoes boots hidden wrist shooter versus web gun holster etc wasn t sure Stan would like idea covering character s face but did it it hid an obviously boyish face It would also add mystery character Although interior artwork was by Ditko alone Lee rejected Ditko s cover art commissioned Kirby pencil cover that Ditko inked As Lee explained in think had Jack sketch out cover it always had lot confidence in Jack s covers In an early recollection character s creation Ditko described his Lee s contributions in mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan Summer Stan Lee thought name up did costume web gimmick on wrist spider signal At time Ditko shared Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton an art school classmate in interview with Theakston recalled that although his contribution Spider Man was almost nil he Ditko had

was gateway commercial success superhero inspired launch Amazing Spider Man comic book Cover art by penciller Jack Kirby inker Steve Ditko Kirby disputed Lee s version story claimed Lee had minimal involvement in character s creation According Kirby idea Spider Man had originated with Kirby Joe Simon in s had developed character called Silver Spider Crestwood Publications comic Black Magic was

disliked results in Simon s description Captain America with cobwebs note Writer Mark Evanier notes that Lee s reasoning that Kirby s character was heroic seems unlikely Kirby still drew covers Amazing Fantasy first issue Amazing Spider Man Evanier also disputes Kirby s given reason that he was busy draw Spider Man in addition his other duties since Kirby was said Evanier always busy Neither Lee s nor Kirby s explanation explains key story elements like magic ring were dropped Evanier states that most plausible explanation sudden change was that Goodman one his assistants decided that Spider Man as drawn envisioned by Kirby was similar Fly Author Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko noted similarities Fly Ditko recalled that Stan called Jack about Fly adding that d ays later Stan told me would be penciling story panel breakdowns from Stan s synopsis It was at this point that nature strip changed Out went magic ring adult Spider Man whatever legend ideas that Spider Man story would have contained Lee gave Ditko premise teenager bitten by spider developing powers premise Ditko would expand upon point he became Bell describes as first work hire artist his generation create control narrative arc his series On issue initial creation Ditko states still don t know whose idea was Spider Man Kirby noted in interview that it was Ditko got Spider Man roll thing caught on he did Lee while claiming credit initial idea has acknowledged Ditko s role stating If Steve wants be called co creator think he deserves it He has further commented that Ditko s
