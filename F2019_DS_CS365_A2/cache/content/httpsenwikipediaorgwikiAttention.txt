Contemporary definition research edit Prior founding psychology as scientific discipline attention was studied in field philosophy Thus many discoveries in field attention were made by philosophers Psychologist John B Watson calls Juan Luis Vives father modern psychology in his book De Anima et Vita Soul Life he was first recognize importance empirical investigation In his work on memory Vives found that more closely one attends stimuli better they will be retained By s psychologists began using positron emission tomography PET later functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI image brain while monitoring tasks involving attention this expensive equipment was generally only available in hospitals psychologists sought cooperation with neurologists Psychologist Michael Posner then already renowned his influential work on visual selective attention neurologist Marcus Raichle pioneered brain imaging studies selective attention results soon sparked interest from neuroscience community which had until then focused on monkey brains With development these technological innovations neuroscientists became interested in this type research that combines sophisticated experimental paradigms from cognitive psychology with these new brain imaging techniques Although older technique electroencephalography EEG had long been used study brain activity underlying selective attention by cognitive psychophysiologists ability newer techniques actually measure precisely localized activity inside brain generated renewed interest by wider community researchers Neuroscientific evidence has identified frontoparietal brain network which appears be responsible many attentional processes Selective visual edit See also Selective auditory attention In cognitive psychology are at least two models which describe visual attention operates These models may be considered loosely as metaphors which are used describe internal processes generate hypotheses that are falsifiable Generally speaking visual attention thought operate as two stage process In first stage attention distributed uniformly over external visual scene processing information performed in parallel In second stage attention concentrated specific area visual scene i e it focused processing performed in serial fashion first these models appear in literature spotlight model term spotlight was inspired by work William James described attention as having focus margin fringe focus an area that extracts information from visual scene with high resolution geometric center which being visual attention directed Surrounding focus fringe attention which extracts information in much more crude fashion i e low resolution This fringe extends out specified area cut off called margin second model called zoom lens model was first introduced in This model inherits all properties spotlight model i e focus fringe margin but it has added property changing in size This size change mechanism was inspired by zoom lens one might find on camera any change in size can be described by trade off in efficiency processing zoom lens attention can be described in terms an inverse trade off between size focus efficiency processing attentional resources are assumed be fixed then it follows that larger focus slower processing will be that region visual scene since this fixed resource will be distributed over larger area It thought that focus attention can subtend minimum visual angle however maximum size has not yet been determined significant debate emerged in last decade th century in which Treisman s Feature Integration Theory FIT was compared Duncan Humphrey s attentional engagement theory AET FIT posits that objects are retrieved from scenes by means selective spatial attention that picks out objects features forms feature maps integrates those features that are found at same location into forming objects Duncan Humphrey s AET understanding attention maintained that an initial pre attentive parallel phase perceptual segmentation analysis that encompasses all visual items present in scene At this phase descriptions objects in visual scene are generated into structural units outcome this parallel phase multiple spatial scale structured representation Selective attention intervenes after this stage select information that will be entered into visual short term memory contrast two theories placed new emphasis on separation visual attention tasks alone those mediated by supplementary cognitive processes As Rastophopoulos summarizes debate Against Treisman s FIT which posits spatial attention as necessary condition detection objects Humphreys argues that visual elements are encoded bound together in an initial parallel phase without focal attention that attention serves select among objects that result from this initial grouping Neuropsychological model edit In twentieth century pioneering research Lev Vygotsky Alexander Luria led three part model neuropsychology defining working brain as being represented by three co active processes listed as Attention Memory Activation Attention identified as one three major co active processes working brain R Luria published his well known book Working Brain in as concise adjunct volume his previous book Higher Cortical Functions in Man In this volume Luria summarized his three part global theory working brain as being composed three constantly co active processes which he described as Attention system Mnestic memory system Cortical activation system two books together are considered by Homskaya s account as among Luria s major works in neuropsychology most fully reflecting all aspects theoretical clinical experimental this new discipline product combined research Vygotsky Luria have determined large part contemporary understanding definition attention as it understood at start st century Multitasking divided edit See also Human multitasking Distracted driving Multitasking can be defined as attempt perform two more tasks simultaneously however research shows that multitasking people make more mistakes perform tasks more slowly Attention must be divided among all component tasks perform them In divided attention individuals attend give attention multiple sources information at once at same time perform more than one task Older research involved looking at limits people performing simultaneous tasks like reading stories while listening writing something else listening two separate messages through different ears i e dichotic listening Generally classical research into attention investigated ability people learn new information were multiple tasks be performed probe limits our perception c f Donald Broadbent also older literature on people s performance on multiple tasks performed simultaneously such as driving car while tuning radio driving while telephoning vast majority current research on human multitasking based on performance doing two tasks simultaneously usually that involves driving while performing another task such as texting eating even speaking passengers in vehicle with friend over cellphone This research reveals that human attentional system has limits it can process driving performance worse while engaged in other tasks drivers make more mistakes brake harder later get into more accidents veer into other lanes are less aware surroundings engaged in previously discussed tasks has been little difference found between speaking on hands free cell phone hand held cell phone which suggests that it strain attentional system that causes problems rather than driver doing with his her hands While speaking with passenger as cognitively demanding as speaking with friend over phone passengers are able change conversation based upon needs driver example if traffic intensifies passenger may stop talking allow driver navigate increasingly difficult roadway conversation partner over phone would not be aware change in environment have been multiple theories regarding divided attention One conceived by Kahneman explains that single pool attentional resources that can be freely divided among multiple tasks This model seems be oversimplified however due different modalities e g visual auditory verbal that are perceived two simultaneous tasks use same modality such as listening radio station writing paper it much more difficult concentrate on both tasks are likely interfere with each other specific modality model was theorized by Navon Gopher in However more recent research using well controlled dual task paradigms points at importance tasks Specifically in spatial visual auditory as well as in spatial visual tactile tasks interference two tasks observed In contrast one tasks involves object detection no interference observed Thus multi modal advantage in attentional resources task dependent As an alternative resource theory has been proposed as more accurate metaphor explaining divided attention on complex tasks Resource theory states that as each complex task automatized performing that task requires less individual s limited capacity attentional resources Other variables play part in our ability pay attention concentrate on many tasks at once These include but are not limited anxiety arousal task difficulty skills Simultaneous edit Simultaneous attention type attention classified by attending multiple events at same time Simultaneous attention demonstrated by children in Indigenous communities learn through this type attention surroundings Simultaneous attention present in ways in which children indigenous backgrounds interact both with surroundings with other individuals Simultaneous attention requires focus on multiple simultaneous activities occurrences This differs from multitasking which characterized by alternating attention focus between multiple activities halting one activity before switching next Simultaneous attention involves uninterrupted attention several activities occurring at same time Another cultural practice that may relate simultaneous attention strategies coordination within group Indigenous heritage toddlers caregivers in San Pedro were observed frequently coordinate activities with other members group in ways parallel model simultaneous attention whereas middle class European descent families in U S would move back forth between events Research concludes that children with close ties Indigenous American roots have high tendency be especially wide keen observers This points strong cultural difference in attention management Alternative topics discussions edit Overt covert orienting edit Attention may be differentiated into overt versus covert orienting Overt orienting act selectively attending an item location over others by moving eyes point in that direction Overt orienting can be directly observed in form eye movements Although overt eye movements are quite common distinction that can be made between two types eye movements reflexive controlled Reflexive movements are commanded by superior colliculus midbrain These movements are fast are activated by sudden appearance stimuli In contrast controlled eye movements are commanded by areas in frontal lobe These movements are slow voluntary Covert orienting act mentally shifting one s focus without moving one s eyes Simply it changes in attention that are not attributable overt eye movements Covert orienting has potential affect output perceptual processes by governing attention particular items locations example activity V neuron whose receptive field lies on an attended stimuli will be enhanced by covert attention but does not influence information that processed by senses Researchers often use filtering tasks study role covert attention selecting information These tasks often require participants observe number stimuli but attend only one current view that visual covert attention mechanism quickly scanning field view interesting locations This shift in covert attention linked eye movement circuitry that sets up slower saccade that location citation needed are studies that suggest mechanisms overt covert orienting may not be controlled separately independently as previously believed Central mechanisms that may control covert orienting such as parietal lobe also receive input from subcortical centres involved in overt orienting In support this general theories attention actively assume bottom up reflexive processes top down voluntary processes converge on common neural architecture in that they control both covert overt attentional systems example if individuals attend right hand corner field view movement eyes in that direction may have be actively suppressed Exogenous endogenous orienting edit Orienting attention vital can be controlled through external exogenous internal endogenous processes However comparing these two processes challenging external signals do not operate completely exogenously but will only summon attention eye movements if they are important subject Exogenous from Greek exo meaning outside genein meaning produce orienting frequently described as being under control stimulus Exogenous orienting considered be reflexive automatic caused by sudden change in periphery This often results in reflexive saccade Since exogenous cues are typically presented in periphery they are referred as peripheral cues Exogenous orienting can even be observed individuals are aware that cue will not relay reliable accurate information about target going occur This means that mere presence an exogenous cue will affect response other stimuli that are subsequently presented in cue s previous location Several studies have investigated influence valid invalid cues They concluded that valid peripheral cues benefit performance instance peripheral cues are brief flashes at relevant location before onset visual stimulus Posner Cohen noted reversal this benefit takes place interval between onset cue onset target longer than about ms phenomenon valid cues producing longer reaction times than invalid cues called inhibition return Endogenous from Greek endo meaning within internally orienting intentional allocation attentional resources predetermined location space Simply stated endogenous orienting occurs attention oriented according an observer s goals desires allowing focus attention be manipulated by demands task In order have an effect endogenous cues must be processed by observer acted upon purposefully These cues are frequently referred as central cues This they are typically presented at center display an observer s eyes are likely be fixated Central cues such as an arrow digit presented at fixation tell observers attend specific location examining differences between exogenous endogenous orienting some researchers suggest that are four differences between two kinds cues exogenous orienting less affected by cognitive load than endogenous orienting observers are able ignore endogenous cues but not exogenous cues exogenous cues have bigger effects than endogenous cues expectancies about cue validity predictive value affects endogenous orienting more than exogenous orienting exist both overlaps differences in areas brain that are responsible endogenous exogenous orientating Another approach this discussion has been covered under topic heading bottom up versus top down orientations attention Researchers this school have described two different aspects mind focuses attention items present in environment first aspect called bottom up processing also known as stimulus driven attention exogenous attention These describe attentional processing which driven by properties objects themselves Some processes such as motion sudden loud noise can attract our attention in pre conscious non volitional way We attend them whether we want not These aspects attention are thought involve parietal temporal cortices as well as brainstem second aspect called top down processing also known as goal driven endogenous attention attentional control executive attention This aspect our attentional orienting under control person attending It mediated primarily by frontal cortex basal ganglia as one executive functions Research has shown that it related other aspects executive functions such as working memory conflict resolution inhibition Influence processing load edit hugely influential theory regarding selective attention perceptual load theory which states that are two mechanisms that affect attention cognitive perceptual perceptual considers subject s ability perceive ignore stimuli both task related non task related Studies show that if are many stimuli present especially if they are task related it much easier ignore non task related stimuli but if are few stimuli mind will perceive irrelevant stimuli as well as relevant cognitive refers actual processing stimuli Studies regarding this showed that ability process stimuli decreased with age meaning that younger people were able perceive more stimuli fully process them but were likely process both relevant irrelevant information while older people could process fewer stimuli but usually processed only relevant information Some people can process multiple stimuli e g trained Morse code operators have been able copy message while carrying on meaningful conversation This relies on reflexive response due overlearning skill morse code reception detection transcription so that it an autonomous function requiring no specific attention perform citation needed Clinical model edit Attention best described as sustained focus cognitive resources on information while filtering ignoring extraneous information Attention very basic function that often precursor all other neurological cognitive functions As frequently case clinical models attention differ from investigation models One most used models evaluation attention in patients with very different neurologic pathologies model Sohlberg Mateer This hierarchic model based in recovering attention processes brain damage patients after coma Five different kinds activities growing difficulty are described in model connecting with activities those patients could do as recovering process advanced Focused attention ability respond discretely specific visual auditory tactile stimuli Sustained attention vigilance concentration ability maintain consistent behavioral response during continuous repetitive activity Selective attention ability maintain behavioral cognitive set in face distracting competing stimuli Therefore it incorporates notion freedom from distractibility Alternating attention ability mental flexibility that allows individuals shift focus attention move between tasks having different cognitive requirements Divided attention This refers ability respond simultaneously multiple tasks multiple task demands This model has been shown be very useful in evaluating attention in very different pathologies correlates strongly with daily difficulties especially helpful in designing stimulation programs such as attention process training rehabilitation program neurological patients same authors Mindfulness Mindfulness has been conceptualized as clinical model attention Mindfulness practices are clinical interventions that emphasize training attention functions Neural correlates edit Most experiments show that one neural correlate attention enhanced firing If neuron has certain response stimulus animal not attending stimulus then animal does attend stimulus neuron s response will be enhanced even if physical characteristics stimulus remain same In review Knudsen describes more general model which identifies four core processes attention with working memory at center Working memory temporarily stores information detailed analysis Competitive selection process that determines which information gains access working memory Through top down sensitivity control higher cognitive processes can regulate signal intensity in information channels that compete access working memory thus give them an advantage in process competitive selection Through top down sensitivity control momentary content working memory can influence selection new information thus mediate voluntary control attention in recurrent loop endogenous attention Bottom up saliency filters automatically enhance response infrequent stimuli stimuli instinctive learned biological relevance exogenous attention Neurally at different hierarchical levels spatial maps can enhance inhibit activity in sensory areas induce orienting behaviors like eye movement At top hierarchy frontal eye fields FEF dorsolateral prefrontal cortex contain retinocentric spatial map Microstimulation in FEF induces monkeys make saccade relevant location Stimulation at levels low induce saccade will nonetheless enhance cortical responses stimuli located in relevant area At next lower level variety spatial maps are found in parietal cortex In particular lateral intraparietal area LIP contains saliency map interconnected both with FEF with sensory areas Certain automatic responses that influence attention like orienting highly salient stimulus are mediated subcortically by superior colliculi At neural network level it thought that processes like lateral inhibition mediate process competitive selection In many cases attention produces changes in EEG Many animals including humans produce gamma waves Hz focusing attention on particular object activity Another commonly used model attention system has been put forth by researchers such as Michael Posner He divides attention into three functional components alerting orienting executive attention that can also interact influence each other Alerting process involved in becoming staying attentive toward surroundings It appears exist in frontal parietal lobes right hemisphere modulated by norepinephrine Orienting directing attention specific stimulus Executive attention used conflict between multiple attention cues It essentially same as central executive in Baddeley s model working memory Eriksen flanker task has shown that executive control attention may take place in anterior cingulate cortex Cultural variation edit Children appear develop patterns attention related cultural practices families communities institutions in which they participate In Jules Henry suggested that are societal differences in sensitivity signals from many ongoing sources that call awareness several levels attention simultaneously He tied his speculation ethnographic observations communities in which children are involved in complex social community with multiple relationships Many Indigenous children in Americas predominantly learn by observing pitching in are several studies support that use keen attention towards learning much more common in Indigenous Communities North Central America than in middle class European American setting This direct result Learning by Observing Pitching In model Keen attention both requirement result learning by observing pitching in Incorporating children in community gives them opportunity keenly observe contribute activities that were not directed towards them It can be seen from different Indigenous communities cultures such as Mayans San Pedro that children can simultaneously attend multiple events Most Maya children have learned pay attention several events at once in order make useful observations One example simultaneous attention which involves uninterrupted attention several activities occurring at same time Another cultural practice that may relate simultaneous attention strategies coordination within group San Pedro toddlers caregivers frequently coordinated activities with other members group in multiway engagements rather than in dyadic fashion Research concludes that children with close ties Indigenous American roots have high tendency be especially keen observers This learning by observing pitching in model requires active levels attention management child present while caretakers engage in daily activities responsibilities such as weaving farming other skills necessary survival Being present allows child focus attention on actions being performed by parents elders older siblings In order learn in this way keen attention focus required Eventually child expected be able perform these skills themselves Modelling edit In domain computer vision efforts have been made model mechanism human attention especially bottom up intentional mechanism its semantic significance in classification video contents Both spatial attention temporal attention have been incorporated in such classification efforts Generally speaking are two kinds models mimic bottom up salience mechanism in static images One way based on spatial contrast analysis example center surround mechanism has been used define salience across scales inspired by putative neural mechanism It has also been hypothesized that some visual inputs are intrinsically salient in certain background contexts that these are actually task independent This model has established itself as exemplar salience detection consistently used comparison in literature other way based on frequency domain analysis This method was first proposed by Hou et al this method was called SR then PQFT method was also introduced Both SR PQFT only use phase information In HFT method was introduced both amplitude phase information are made use Hemispatial neglect edit Main article Hemispatial neglect Hemispatial neglect also called unilateral neglect often occurs people have damage right hemisphere This damage often leads tendency ignore left side one s body even left side an object that can be seen Damage left side brain left hemisphere rarely yields significant neglect right side body object in person s local environments effects spatial neglect however may vary differ depending on area brain was damaged Damage different neural substrates can result in different types neglect Attention disorders lateralized nonlaterized may also contribute symptoms effects Much research has asserted that damage gray matter within brain results in spatial neglect New technology has yielded more information such that large distributed network frontal parietal temporal subcortical brain areas that have been tied neglect This network can be related other research as well dorsal attention network tied spatial orienting effect damage this network may result in patients neglecting left side distracted about right side an object on right side Attention in social contexts edit Social attention one special form attention that involves allocation limited processing resources in social context Previous studies on social attention often regard attention directed toward socially relevant stimuli such as faces gaze directions other individuals In contrast attending others different line researches has shown that self related information such as own face name automatically captures attention preferentially processed comparing other related information These contrasting effects between attending others attending self prompt synthetic view in recent Opinion article proposing that social attention operates at two polarizing states In one extreme individual tends attend self prioritize self related information over others in other extreme attention allocated other individuals infer intentions desires Attending self attending others mark two ends an otherwise continuum spectrum social attention given behavioral context mechanisms underlying these two polarities might interact compete with each other in order determine saliency map social attention that guides our behaviors An imbalanced competition between these two behavioral cognitive processes will cause cognitive disorders neurological symptoms such as autism spectrum disorders Williams syndrome Distracting factors edit According Daniel Goleman s book Focus Hidden Driver Excellence are two types distracting factors regarding focus sensory emotional An example sensory distracting factor would be example while person reading this article he she neglecting white field which surrounds text An example emotional distracting factor would be person focused on answering an email example somebody shouts name It would be almost impossible neglect voice which pronouncing it attention immediately directed towards being said about this person History study edit Philosophical period edit Psychologist Daniel E Berlyne credits first extended treatment attention philosopher Nicolas Malebranche in his work Search After Truth Malebranche held that we have access ideas mental representations external world but not direct access world itself Thus in order keep these ideas organized attention necessary Otherwise we will confuse these ideas Malebranche writes in Search After Truth it often happens that understanding has only confused imperfect perceptions things it truly cause our errors It therefore necessary look means keep our perceptions from being confused imperfect as everyone knows nothing that makes them clearer more distinct than attentiveness we must try find means become more attentive than we are According Malebranche attention crucial understanding keeping thoughts organized Philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz introduced concept apperception this philosophical approach attention Apperception refers process by which new experience assimilated transformed by residuum past experience an individual form new whole Apperception required perceived event become conscious event Leibniz emphasized reflexive involuntary view attention known as exogenous orienting However also endogenous orienting which voluntary directed attention Philosopher Johann Friedrich Herbart agreed with Leibniz s view apperception however he expounded on it in by saying that new experiences had be tied ones already existing in mind Herbart was also first person stress importance applying mathematical modeling study psychology In beginning th century it was thought that people were not able attend more than one stimulus at time However with research contributions by Sir William Hamilton th Baronet this view was changed Hamilton proposed view attention that likened its capacity holding marbles can only hold certain amount marbles at time before it starts spill over His view states that we can attend more than one stimulus at once William Stanley Jevons later expanded this view stated that we can attend up four items at time citation needed During this period attention various philosophers made significant contributions field They began research on extent attention attention directed edit This period attention research took focus from conceptual findings experimental testing It also involved psychophysical methods that allowed measurement relation between physical stimulus properties psychological perceptions them This period covers development attentional research from founding psychology Wilhelm Wundt introduced study attention field psychology Wundt measured mental processing speed by likening it differences in stargazing measurements Astronomers in this time would measure time it took stars travel Among these measurements astronomers recorded times were personal differences in calculation These different readings resulted in different reports from each astronomer correct this personal equation was developed Wundt applied this mental processing speed Wundt realized that time it takes see stimulus star write down time was being called an observation error but actually was time it takes switch voluntarily one s attention from one stimulus another Wundt called his school psychology voluntarism It was his belief that psychological processes can only be understood in terms goals consequences Franciscus Donders used mental chronometry study attention it was considered major field intellectual inquiry by authors such as Sigmund Freud Donders his students conducted first detailed investigations speed mental processes Donders measured time required identify stimulus select motor response This was time difference between stimulus discrimination response initiation Donders also formalized subtractive method which states that time particular process can be estimated by adding that process task taking difference in reaction time between two tasks He also differentiated between three types reactions simple reaction choice reaction go no go reaction Hermann von Helmholtz also contributed field attention relating extent attention Von Helmholtz stated that it possible focus on one stimulus still perceive ignore others An example this being able focus on letter u in word house still perceiving letters h o s e One major debate in this period was whether it was possible attend two things at once split attention Walter Benjamin described this experience as reception in state distraction This disagreement could only be resolved through experimentation In William James in his textbook Principles Psychology remarked Everyone knows attention It taking possession by mind in clear vivid form one out seem several simultaneously possible objects trains thought Focalization concentration consciousness are its essence It implies withdrawal from some things in order deal effectively with others condition which has real opposite in confused dazed scatterbrained state which in French called distraction Zerstreutheit in German James differentiated between censorial attention intellectual attention Censorial attention attention directed objects sense stimuli that are physically present Intellectual attention attention directed ideal represented objects stimuli that are not physically present James also distinguished between immediate derived attention attention present versus something not physically present According James attention has five major effects Attention works make us perceive conceive distinguish remember shorten reactions time edit During this period research in attention waned interest in behaviorism flourished leading some believe like Ulric Neisser that in this period was no research on attention However Jersild published very important work on Mental Set Shift in He stated fact mental set primary in all conscious activity same stimulus may evoke any one large number responses depending upon contextual setting in which it placed This research found that time complete list was longer mixed lists than pure lists example if list was names animals versus list same size with names animals books makes models cars types fruits it takes longer process second list This task switching In Telford discovered psychological refractory period stimulation neurons followed by refractory phase during which neurons are less sensitive stimulation In John Ridley Stroop developed Stroop Task which elicited Stroop Effect Stroop s task showed that irrelevant stimulus information can have major impact on performance In this task subjects were look at list colors This list colors had each color typed in color different from actual text example word Blue would be typed in Orange Pink in Black so on Example Blue Purple Red Green Purple Green Subjects were then instructed say name ink color ignore text It took seconds complete list this type compared seconds name colors presented in form solid squares naming time nearly doubled in presence conflicting color words an effect known as Stroop Effect edit In s research psychologists renewed interest in attention dominant epistemology shifted from positivism i e behaviorism realism during has come be known as cognitive revolution cognitive revolution admitted unobservable cognitive processes like attention as legitimate objects scientific study Modern research on attention began with analysis cocktail party problem by Colin Cherry in At cocktail party do people select conversation that they are listening ignore rest This problem at times called focused attention as opposed divided attention Cherry performed number experiments which became known as dichotic listening were extended by Donald Broadbent others In typical experiment subjects would use set headphones listen two streams words in different ears selectively attend one stream After task experimenter would question subjects about content unattended stream Broadbent s Filter Model Attention states that information held in pre attentive temporary store only sensory events that have some physical feature in common are selected pass into limited capacity processing system This implies that meaning unattended messages not identified Also significant amount time required shift filter from one channel another Experiments by Gray Wedderburn later Anne Treisman pointed out various problems in Broadbent s early model eventually led Deutsch Norman model in In this model no signal filtered out but all are processed point activating stored representations in memory point at which attention becomes selective one memory representations selected further processing At any time only one can be selected resulting in attentional bottleneck This debate became known as early selection vs late selection models In early selection models first proposed by Donald Broadbent attention shuts down in Broadbent s model attenuates in Triesman s refinement processing in unattended ear before mind can analyze its semantic content In late selection models first proposed by J Anthony Deutsch Diana Deutsch content in both ears analyzed semantically but words in unattended ear cannot access consciousness Lavie s perceptual load theory however provided elegant solution had once been heated debate See also edit
