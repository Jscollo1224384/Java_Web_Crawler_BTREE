earned him worldwide reputation numerous honours including an honorary degree from Clark University Massachusetts in another honorary degree from Harvard University in recognition from University Oxford University Calcutta appointment as Fellow Royal Society Medicine England In Jung met Sigmund Freud in Vienna Austria six years two scholars worked together in they founded International Psychoanalytical Association which Jung was first president However early in collaboration Jung observed that Freud would not tolerate ideas that were different from his own In Jung s Psychology Unconscious Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido was published re published as Symbols Transformation in C W Vol work s innovative ideas contributed new foundation in psychology as well as end Jung Freud friendship in two scholars continued work on personality development independently Jung s approach called Analytical Psychology German analytische Psychologie Freud s approach referred as Psychoanalytic School psychoanalytische Schule which he founded Unlike most modern psychologists Jung did not believe that experiments using natural science were only means gain an understanding human psyche He saw as empirical evidence world dream myth folklore as promising road deeper understanding meaning That method s choice related with his choice object his science As Jung said beauty about unconscious that it really unconscious Hence unconscious untouchable by experimental researches indeed any possible kind scientific philosophical reach precisely it unconscious citation needed Although unconscious cannot be studied by using direct approaches it according Jung at least useful hypothesis His postulated unconscious was quite different from model that was proposed by Freud despite great influence that founder psychoanalysis had on Jung most well known difference assumption collective unconscious see also Jungian archetypes although Jung s proposal collective unconscious archetypes was based on assumption existence psychic mental patterns These patterns include conscious contents thoughts memories etc from life experience They are common all human beings His proof vast collective unconscious was his concept synchronicity that inexplicable uncanny connectedness that we all share overarching goal Jungian psychology attainment self through individuation Jung defines self as archetype wholeness regulating center psyche Central this process individual s encounter with his her psyche bringing its elements into consciousness Humans experience unconscious through symbols encountered in all aspects life in dreams art religion symbolic dramas we enact in our relationships life pursuits Essential this numinous encounter merging individual s consciousness with collective consciousness through this symbolic language By bringing conscious awareness not conscious unconscious elements can be integrated with consciousness they surface Neurosis results from disharmony between individual s un consciousness his higher Self psyche self regulating adaptive system Humans are energetic systems if energy gets blocked psyche gets stuck sick If adaptation thwarted psychic energy stops flowing regresses This process manifests in neurosis psychosis Human psychic contents are complex deep They can schism split form complexes that take over one s personality Jung proposed that this occurs through maladaptation one s external internal realities principles adaptation projection compensation are central processes in Jung s view psyche s ability adapt aim psychotherapy assist individual in reestablishing healthy relationship unconscious neither flooded by it characteristic psychosis such as schizophrenia out balance in relationship it as with neurosis state that results in depression anxiety personality disorders undergo individuation process individuals must be open parts themselves beyond own ego modern individual grows continually in psychic awareness through attention dreams exploration religion spirituality by questioning assumptions operant societal worldview rather than just blindly living life in accordance with dominant norms assumptions Fundamentals edit Unconscious edit Main articles Unconscious mind Collective unconscious Archetypes basic assumption that personal unconscious potent part probably more active part normal human psyche Reliable communication between conscious unconscious parts psyche necessary wholeness Also crucial belief that dreams show ideas beliefs feelings that individuals are not readily aware but need be that such material expressed in personalized vocabulary visual metaphors Things known but unknown are contained in unconscious dreams are one main vehicles unconscious express them Analytical psychology distinguishes between personal unconscious collective unconscious collective unconscious contains archetypes common all human beings That individuation may bring surface symbols that do not relate life experiences single person This content more easily viewed as answers more fundamental questions humanity life death meaning happiness fear Among these more spiritual concepts may arise be integrated into personality Collective unconscious edit Main article Collective unconscious Jung s concept collective unconscious has often been misunderstood it related Jungian archetypes citation needed term collective unconscious first appeared in Jung s essay Structure Unconscious This essay distinguishes between personal Freudian unconscious filled with fantasies e g sexual repressed images collective unconscious encompassing soul humanity at large In Significance Constitution Heredity in Psychology November Jung wrote essential thing psychologically that in dreams fantasies other exceptional states mind most far fetched mythological motifs symbols can appear autochthonously at any time often apparently as result particular influences traditions excitations working on individual but more often without any sign them These primordial images archetypes as have called them belong basic stock unconscious psyche cannot be explained as personal acquisitions Together they make up that psychic stratum which has been called collective unconscious existence collective unconscious means that individual consciousness anything but tabula rasa not immune predetermining influences On contrary it in highest degree influenced by inherited presuppositions quite apart from unavoidable influences exerted upon it by environment collective unconscious comprises in itself psychic life our ancestors right back earliest beginnings It matrix all conscious psychic occurrences hence it exerts an influence that compromises freedom consciousness in highest degree since it continually striving lead all conscious processes back into old paths Archetypes edit Main article Jungian archetypes use psychological archetypes was advanced by Jung in In Jung s psychological framework archetypes are innate universal prototypes ideas may be used interpret observations group memories interpretations associated with an archetype complex e g mother complex associated with mother archetype Jung treated archetypes as psychological organs analogous physical ones in that both are morphological givens that arose through evolution Archetypes are collective as well as individual can grow on own present themselves in variety creative ways Jung in his book Memories Dreams Reflections states that he began see talk manifestation anima that she taught him interpret dreams As soon as he could interpret on his own Jung said that she ceased talking him she was no longer needed Self realization neuroticism edit Main articles Self realization Neuroticism An innate need self realization leads people explore integrate these disowned parts themselves This natural process called individuation process becoming an individual According Jung self realization attained through individuation His an adult psychology divided into two distinct tiers In first half our lives we separate from humanity We attempt create our own identities myself This such need young men be destructive can be expressed as animosity from teens directed at parents Jung also said we have sort second puberty that occurs between ages outlook shifts from emphasis on materialism sexuality having children concerns about community spirituality In second half our lives humans reunite with human race They become part collective once again This adults start contribute humanity volunteer time build garden create art etc rather than destroy They are also more likely pay attention unconscious conscious feelings Young men rarely say feel angry feel sad This they have not yet rejoined human collective experience commonly reestablished in older wiser years according Jung common theme young rebels search true selves realize that contribution humanity essentially necessity whole self Jung proposes that ultimate goal collective unconscious self realization pull us highest experience This course spiritual If person does not proceed toward self knowledge neurotic symptoms may arise Symptoms are widely defined including instance phobias psychosis depression Shadow edit shadow an unconscious complex defined as repressed suppressed disowned qualities conscious self According Jung human being deals with reality shadow in four ways denial projection integration transmutation citation needed According analytical psychology person s shadow may have both constructive destructive aspects In its more destructive aspects shadow can represent those things people do not accept about themselves instance shadow someone identifies as being kind may be harsh unkind Conversely shadow person perceives himself be brutal may be gentle In its more constructive aspects person s shadow may represent hidden positive qualities This has been referred as gold in shadow Jung emphasized importance being aware shadow material incorporating it into conscious awareness in order avoid projecting shadow qualities on others shadow in dreams often represented by dark figures same gender as dreamer shadow may also concern great figures in history human thought even spiritual masters became great shadows ability live shadows namely unconscious faults in full without repressing them Anima animus edit Main article Anima animus Jung identified anima as being unconscious feminine component men animus as unconscious masculine component in women However this rarely taken as literal definition many modern day Jungian practitioners believe that every person has both an anima an animus Jung considered instance an animus anima in men in his work Aion in an interview in which he says Yes if man realizes animus his anima then animus substitute old wise man see his ego in relation unconscious unconscious personified by female figure anima But in unconscious also masculine figure wise old man that figure in connection with anima as her animus she woman So one could say wise old man was in exactly same position as animus woman Jung stated that anima animus act as guides unconscious unified Self that forming an awareness connection with anima animus one most difficult rewarding steps in psychological growth Jung reported that he identified his anima as she spoke him as an inner voice unexpectedly one day Often people ignore anima animus complexes anima animus vies attention by projecting itself on others This explains according Jung we are sometimes immediately attracted certain strangers we see our anima animus in them Love at first sight an example anima animus projection Moreover people strongly identify with gender role e g man acts aggressively never cries have not actively recognized engaged anima animus Jung attributes human rational thought be male nature while irrational aspect considered be natural female rational being defined as involving judgment irrational being defined as involving perceptions Consequently irrational moods are progenies male anima shadow irrational opinions female animus shadow Wise old man woman edit Main article Wise old man After confrontation with soul image appearance old wise man personification spiritual principle can be distinguished as next milestone inner development As archetypes collective unconscious such figures can be seen as in psychological terms symbolic personification Self Psychoanalysis edit Main articles Psychoanalysis Dream analysis Analysis way experience integrate unknown material It search meaning behaviours symptoms events Many are channels reach this greater self knowledge analysis dreams most common Others may include expressing feelings in art pieces poetry other expressions creativity Giving complete description process dream interpretation individuation complex nature complexity lies in fact that process highly specific person does it While Freudian psychoanalysis assumes that repressed material hidden in unconscious given by repressed sexual instincts analytical psychology has more general approach no preconceived assumption about unconscious material unconscious Jungian analysts may contain repressed sexual drives but also aspirations fears etc Psychological types edit Main article Psychological types Analytical psychology distinguishes several psychological types temperaments Extravert Introvert According Jung psyche an apparatus adaptation orientation consists number different psychic functions Among these he distinguishes four basic functions Sensation Perception by means sense organs Intuition Perceiving in unconscious way perception unconscious contents Thinking Function intellectual cognition forming logical conclusions Feeling Function subjective estimation Thinking feeling functions are rational while sensation intuition functions are irrational Note ambiguity in term rational that Carl Jung ascribed thinking feeling functions Both thinking feeling irrespective orientation i e introverted extroverted employ utilize are directed by in loose terminology an underlying logical IF THEN construct process as in IF X THEN Y in order form judgments This underlying construct process not directly observable in normal states consciousness especially engaged in thoughts feelings It can be cognized merely as concept abstraction during thoughtful reflection Sensation intuition are irrational functions simply they do not employ above mentioned underlying logical construct process See also Myers Briggs Type Indicator Socionics Complexes edit Main article Complex psychology Early in Jung s career he coined term described concept complex Jung claims have discovered concept during his free association galvanic skin response experiments Freud obviously took up this concept in his Oedipus complex amongst others Jung seemed see complexes as quite autonomous parts psychological life It almost as if Jung were describing separate personalities within considered single individual but equate Jung s use complexes with something along lines multiple personality disorder would be step out bounds Jung saw an archetype as always being central organizing structure complex instance in negative mother complex archetype negative mother would be seen be central identity that complex This say our psychological lives are patterned on common human experiences Jung saw Ego which Freud wrote about in German literally as one s conscious experience oneself as complex If complex might be archetype that structures it Jung many Jungians might say hero one separates from community ultimately carry community further Clinical theories edit Main article Psychoanalysis Jung s writings have been studied by people many backgrounds interests including theologians people from humanities mythologists Jung often seemed seek make contributions various fields but he was mostly practicing psychiatrist involved during his whole career in treating patients description Jung s clinical relevance address core his work Jung started his career working with hospitalized patients with major mental illnesses most notably schizophrenia He was interested in possibilities an unknown brain toxin that could be cause schizophrenia But majority heart Jung s clinical career was taken up with we might call today individual psychodynamic psychotherapy in gross structure very much in strain psychoanalytic practice first formed by Freud It important state that Jung seemed often see his work as not complete psychology in itself but as his unique contribution field psychology Jung claimed late in his career that only about third his patients did he use Jungian analysis another third Freudian psychology seemed best suit patient s needs final third Adlerian analysis was most appropriate In fact it seems that most contemporary Jungian clinicians merge developmentally grounded theory such as Self psychology Donald Winnicott s work with Jungian theories in order have whole theoretical repertoire actual clinical work Ego tremendously important Jung s clinical work Jung s theory etiology psychopathology could almost be simplified be stated as rigid conscious attitude towards whole psyche That psychotic episode can be seen from Jungian perspective as rest psyche overwhelming conscious psyche conscious psyche effectively was locking out repressing psyche as whole Post Jungian approaches edit Andrew Samuels has distinguished three distinct traditions approaches post Jungian psychology classical developmental archetypal Today are more developments Classical edit classical approach tries remain faithful Jung proposed taught in person in his plus volumes work Prominent advocates this approach according Samuels include Emma Jung C G Jung s wife was an analyst in her own right Marie Louise von Franz Joseph L Henderson Aniela Jaff Erich Neumann Gerhard Adler Jolande Jacobi Developmental edit developmental approach primarily associated with Erich Neumann Origins Conscious Origins Child Jung credited Neumann as student advancing his Jung s theory into developmental model based on mythological approach He described three broad myths Creation Hero Transcendence Expansion Jungian theory also credited Michael Fordham his wife Frieda Fordham It can be considered bridge between traditional Jungian analysis Melanie Klein s object relations theory Laings Goodheart are also often mentioned Samuels considers J Redfearn Richard Carvalho himself Andrew Samuels as representatives developmental approach Samuels notes this approach differs from classical by giving less emphasis Self more emphasis development personality he also notes in terms practice in therapy it gives more attention transference counter transference than either classical archetypal approaches Archetypal edit Main articles Archetypal psychology Archetypal Mythopoetic men s movement One archetypal approach sometimes called imaginal school by James Hillman was written about by him in late s early s Its adherents according Samuels include Murray Stein Rafael Lopez Pedraza Wolfgang Giegerich Thomas Moore also was influenced by some Hillman s work Developed independently other psychoanalysts have created strong approaches archetypal psychology Mythopoeticists psychoanalysts such as Clarissa Pinkola Est s believes that ethnic aboriginal people are originators archetypal psychology have long carried maps journey soul in songs tales dream telling art rituals Marion Woodman proposes feminist viewpoint regarding archetypal psychology Some mythopoetic archetypal psychology creators either imagine Self not be main archetype collective unconscious as Jung thought but rather assign each archetype equal value citation needed Others are modern progenitors archetypal psychology such as Est s think Self as thing that contains yet suffused by all other archetypes each giving life other Robert L Moore has explored archetypal level human psyche in series five books co authored with Douglas Gillette which have played an important role in men s movement in United States Moore studies computerese so he uses computer s hard wiring its fixed physical components as metaphor archetypal level human psyche Personal experiences influence access archetypal level human psyche but personalized ego consciousness can be likened computer software citation needed Process oriented psychology edit Main article Process oriented psychology Process oriented psychology also called Process work associated with Zurich trained Jungian analyst Arnold Mindell Process work developed in late s early s was originally identified as daughter Jungian psychology citation needed Process work stresses awareness unconscious as an ongoing flow experience This approach expands Jung s work beyond verbal individual therapy include body experience altered comatose states as well as
