chance compete Youth Olympic Games were conceived by IOC president Jacques Rogge in approved during th Congress IOC first Summer Youth Games were held in Singapore from August while inaugural Winter Games were hosted in Innsbruck Austria two years later These Games will be shorter than senior Games summer version will last twelve days while winter version will last nine days IOC allows athletes officials participate at Summer Youth Games athletes officials at Winter Youth Games sports be contested will coincide with those scheduled senior Games however will be variations on sports including mixed NOC mixed gender teams as well as reduced number disciplines events Continental Games st century games From participants representing nations in Games have grown about competitors from nations at Summer Olympics scope scale Winter Olympics smaller example Sochi hosted athletes from nations competing in events during Winter Olympics During Games most athletes officials are housed in Olympic Village This village intended be self contained home all Olympic participants furnished with cafeterias health clinics locations religious expression IOC allowed formation National Olympic Committees representing nations that did not meet strict requirements political sovereignty that other international organisations demand As result colonies dependencies are permitted compete at Olympic Games Examples this include territories such as Puerto Rico Bermuda Hong Kong all which compete as separate nations despite being legally part another country current version Charter allows establishment new National Olympic Committees represent nations which qualify as an independent State recognised by international community Therefore it did not allow formation National Olympic Committees Sint Maarten Cura ao they gained same constitutional status as Aruba in although IOC had recognised Aruban Olympic Committee in After Netherlands Antilles athletes can choose represent either Netherlands Aruba Cost Games See also Cost Olympic Games Oxford Olympics Study found that sports related costs Summer Games since were on average US billion Winter Games billion This does not include wider infrastructure costs like roads urban rail airports which often cost as much more than sports related costs most expensive Summer Games were Beijing at US billion most expensive Winter Games were Sochi at US billion As costs per athlete were on average US Summer Games million Winter Games London cost per athlete was million Sochi million ambitious construction games in Montreal games in Moscow had saddled organisers with expenses greatly in excess revenues host Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses by using existing facilities that were paid by corporate sponsors Olympic Committee led by Peter Ueberroth used some profits endow LA Foundation promote youth sports in Southern California educate coaches maintain sports library Summer Olympics are often considered most financially successful modern Olympics model future Games Budget overruns are common Games Average overrun Games since in real terms which means that actual costs turned out be on average times budget that was estimated at time winning bid host Games Montreal had highest cost overrun Summer Games any Games at Lake Placid had highest cost overrun Winter Games at London had cost overrun Sochi Economic social impact on host cities countries Many economists are sceptical about economic benefits hosting Olympic Games emphasising that such mega events often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in long run Conversely hosting even bidding Olympics appears increase host country s exports as host candidate country sends signal about trade openness bidding host Games Moreover research suggests that hosting Summer Olympics has strong positive effect on philanthropic contributions corporations headquartered in host city which seems benefit local nonprofit sector This positive effect begins in years leading up Games might persist several years afterwards although not permanently This finding suggests that hosting Olympics might create opportunities cities influence local corporations in ways that benefit local nonprofit sector civil society Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities example Centre on Housing Rights Evictions reports that Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups Winter Olympics in Sochi were most expensive Olympic Games in history costing in excess US billion According report by European Bank Reconstruction Development that was released at time games this cost will not boost Russia s national economy but may attract business Sochi southern Krasnodar region Russia in future as result improved services But by December Guardian stated that Sochi now feels like ghost town citing spread out nature stadiums arenas still unfinished construction overall effects Russia s political economic turmoil Furthermore at least four cities withdrew bids Winter Olympics citing high costs lack local support resulting in only two city race between Almaty Kazakhstan Beijing China Thus in July Guardian stated that biggest threat future Olympics that very few cities want host them Bidding Summer Olympics also became two city race between Paris Los Angeles so IOC took unusual step simultaneously awarding both Games Paris Games Los Angeles Los Angeles bid was praised by IOC using record breaking number existing temporary facilities relying on corporate money International Olympic Committee Main article International Olympic Committee IOC headquarters at Lausanne Olympic Movement encompasses large number national international sporting organisations federations recognised media partners as well as athletes officials judges every other person institution that agrees abide by rules Olympic Charter As umbrella organisation Olympic Movement International Olympic Committee IOC responsible selecting host city overseeing planning Olympic Games updating approving sports program negotiating sponsorship

announcement each country during parade nations in opening ceremony spoken in these three more languages main two depending on whether host country an English French speaking country French always spoken first followed by an English translation then dominant language host nation this not English French Criticism IOC has often been criticised being an intractable organisation with several members on committee life presidential terms Avery Brundage Juan Antonio Samaranch were especially controversial Brundage fought strongly amateurism against commercialization Olympic Games even as these stands came be seen as incongruous with realities modern sports advent state sponsored athlete Eastern Bloc countries further eroded ideology pure amateur as it put self financed amateurs Western countries at disadvantage Brundage was accused both racism resisting exclusion apartheid South Africa antisemitism Under Samaranch presidency office was accused both nepotism corruption Samaranch s ties with Franco regime in Spain were also source criticism In it was reported that several IOC members had taken gifts from members Salt Lake City bid committee hosting Winter Olympics Soon four independent investigations were underway by IOC United States Olympic Committee USOC SLOC United States Department Justice Although nothing strictly illegal had been done it was felt that acceptance gifts was morally dubious As result investigation ten members IOC were expelled another ten were sanctioned Stricter rules were adopted future bids caps were put into place as much IOC members could accept from bid cities Additionally new term age limits were put into place IOC membership fifteen former Olympic athletes were added committee Nevertheless from sporting business standpoints Olympics were one most successful Winter Olympiads in history records were set in both broadcasting marketing programs Over billion viewers watched more than billion viewer hours Games were also financially successful raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games which left SLOC with surplus million surplus was used create Utah Athletic Foundation which maintains operates many remaining Olympic venues it was reported that Nagano Olympic bid committee had spent approximately million entertain IOC members many companions precise figures are unknown since Nagano after IOC asked that entertainment expenditures not be made public destroyed financial records BBC documentary entitled Panorama Buying Games aired in August investigated taking bribes in bidding process Summer Olympics documentary claimed it was possible bribe IOC members into voting particular candidate city After being narrowly defeated in bid Summer Games Parisian mayor Bertrand Delano specifically accused British prime minister Tony Blair London Bid Committee headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe breaking bid rules He cited French president Jacques Chirac as witness Chirac gave guarded interviews regarding his involvement allegation was never fully explored Turin bid Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy prominent IOC member Marc Hodler strongly connected with rival bid Sion Switzerland alleged bribery IOC officials by members Turin Organising Committee These accusations led wide ranging investigation allegations also served sour many IOC members against Sion s bid potentially helped Turin capture host city nomination In July Anti Defamation League called continued refusal by International Olympic Committee hold moment silence at opening ceremony eleven Israeli athletes killed by Palestinian terrorists at Munich Olympics continuing stubborn insensitivity callousness memory murdered Israeli athletes Commercialisation Under national organising committees Olympics have been commercialised various degrees since initial Summer Olympics in Athens number companies paid advertising including Kodak In Oxo Odol mouthwash Indian Foot Powder became official sponsors London Olympic Games Coca Cola sponsored Summer Olympics has subsequently remained sponsor current time Before IOC took control sponsorship national organising committees were responsible negotiating own contracts sponsorship use Olympic symbols Under IOC control IOC originally resisted funding by corporate sponsors It was not until retirement IOC President Avery Brundage in that IOC began explore potential television medium lucrative advertising markets available them Under leadership Juan Antonio Samaranch Games began shift toward international sponsors sought link products Olympic brand Budget During first half th century IOC ran on small budget As president IOC from Avery Brundage rejected all attempts link Olympics with commercial interest Brundage believed lobby corporate interests would unduly impact IOC s decision making Brundage s resistance this revenue stream meant IOC left organising committees negotiate own sponsorship contracts use Olympic symbols Brundage retired IOC had US million in assets eight years later IOC coffers had swelled US million This was primarily due shift in ideology toward expansion Games through corporate sponsorship sale television rights Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in his desire was make IOC financially independent Summer Olympics became watershed moment in Olympic history Los Angeles based organising committee led by Peter Ueberroth was able generate surplus US million which was an unprecedented amount at that time organising committee had been able create such surplus in part by selling exclusive sponsorship rights select companies IOC sought gain control these sponsorship rights Samaranch helped establish Olympic Programme TOP in in order create an Olympic brand Membership in TOP was very exclusive expensive Fees cost US million four year membership Members TOP received exclusive global advertising rights product category use Olympic symbol interlocking rings in publications advertisements Effect television cartoon from Olympics imagines year spectators will have been replaced by television radio cheers coming from loudspeakers Summer Olympics in Berlin were first Games be broadcast on television though only local audiences Winter Olympics were first internationally televised Olympic Games following Winter Games had broadcasting rights sold first time specialised television broadcasting networks CBS paid US American rights In following decades Olympics became one ideological fronts Cold War IOC wanted take advantage this heightened interest via broadcast medium sale broadcast rights enabled IOC increase exposure Olympic Games thereby generating more interest which in turn created more appeal advertisers time on television This cycle allowed IOC charge ever increasing fees those rights example CBS paid US million American broadcast rights Nagano Games while NBC spent US billion American rights all Olympic Games from In NBC agreed billion contract with International Olympic Committee broadcast Olympics through games most expensive television rights deal in Olympic history NBC then agreed billion contract extension on May air Olympics through games NBC also acquired American television rights Youth Olympic Games beginning in Paralympic Games More than half Olympic Committee s global sponsors are American companies NBC one major sources revenue IOC Viewership increased exponentially from s until end century This was due use satellites broadcast live television worldwide in introduction colour television in Global audience estimates Mexico City Games was million whereas at Los Angeles Games audience numbers had increased million that number swelled billion by Summer Olympics in Barcelona With such high costs charged broadcast Games added pressure internet increased competition from cable television lobby demanded concessions from IOC boost ratings IOC responded by making number changes Olympic program At Summer Games gymnastics competition was expanded from seven nine nights Champions Gala was added draw greater interest IOC also expanded swimming diving programs both popular sports with broad base television viewers Due substantial fees NBC has paid rights Olympics IOC has allowed NBC have influence on event scheduling maximize U S television ratings possible Olympic marketing sale Olympic brand has been controversial argument that Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised sporting spectacle Another criticism that Games are funded by host cities national governments IOC incurs none cost yet controls all rights profits from Olympic symbols IOC also takes percentage all sponsorship broadcast income Host cities continue compete ardently right host Games even though no certainty that they will earn back investments Research has shown that trade around percent higher countries that have hosted Olympics Symbols Main article Olympic symbols Olympic flag
