intelligence book Data mining Practical machine learning tools techniques with Java which covers mostly machine learning material was originally be named just Practical machine learning term data mining was only added marketing reasons Often more general terms large scale data analysis analytics referring actual methods artificial intelligence machine learning are more appropriate actual data mining task semi automatic automatic analysis large quantities data extract previously unknown interesting patterns such as groups data records cluster analysis unusual records anomaly detection dependencies association rule mining sequential pattern mining This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices These patterns can then be seen as kind summary input data may be used in further analysis example in machine learning predictive analytics example data mining step might identify multiple groups in data which can then be used obtain more accurate prediction results

links Etymology edit In s statisticians economists used terms like data fishing data dredging refer they considered bad practice analyzing data without an priori hypothesis term data mining was used in similarly critical way by economist Michael Lovell in an article published in Review Economic Studies Lovell indicates that practice masquerades under variety aliases ranging from experimentation positive fishing snooping negative term data mining appeared around in database community generally with positive connotations short time in s phrase database mining was used but since it was trademarked by HNC San Diego based company pitch Database Mining Workstation researchers consequently turned data mining Other terms used include data archaeology information harvesting information discovery knowledge extraction etc Gregory Piatetsky Shapiro coined term knowledge discovery in databases first workshop on same topic KDD this term became more popular in AI machine learning community However term data mining became more popular in business press communities Currently terms data mining knowledge discovery are used interchangeably In academic community major forums research started in First International Conference on Data Mining Knowledge Discovery KDD was started in Montreal under AAAI sponsorship It was co chaired by Usama Fayyad Ramasamy Uthurusamy year later in Usama Fayyad launched journal by Kluwer called Data Mining Knowledge Discovery as its founding editor in chief Later he started SIGKDD Newsletter SIGKDD Explorations KDD International conference became primary highest quality conference in data mining with an acceptance rate research paper submissions below journal Data Mining Knowledge Discovery primary research journal field Background edit manual extraction patterns from data has occurred centuries Early methods identifying patterns in data include Bayes theorem s regression analysis s proliferation ubiquity increasing power computer technology has dramatically increased data collection storage manipulation ability As data sets have grown in size complexity direct hands on data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect automated data processing aided by other discoveries in computer science such as neural networks cluster analysis genetic algorithms s decision trees decision rules s support vector machines s Data mining process applying these methods with intention uncovering hidden patterns in large data sets It bridges gap from applied statistics artificial intelligence which usually provide mathematical background database management by exploiting way data stored indexed in databases execute actual learning discovery algorithms more efficiently allowing such methods be applied ever larger data sets Process edit knowledge discovery in databases KDD process commonly defined with stages Selection Pre processing Transformation Data mining Interpretation evaluation It exists however in many variations on this theme such as Cross industry standard process data mining CRISP DM which defines six phases Business understanding Data understanding Data preparation Modeling Evaluation Deployment simplified process such as Pre processing Data Mining Results Validation Polls conducted in show that CRISP DM methodology leading methodology used by data miners only other data mining standard named in these polls was SEMMA However times as many people reported using CRISP DM Several teams researchers have published reviews data mining process models Azevedo Santos conducted comparison CRISP DM SEMMA in Pre processing edit Before data mining algorithms can be used target data set must be assembled As data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in data target data set must be large enough contain these patterns while remaining concise enough be mined within an acceptable time limit common source data data mart data warehouse Pre processing essential analyze multivariate data sets before data mining target set then cleaned Data cleaning removes observations containing noise those with missing data Data mining edit Data mining involves six common classes tasks Anomaly detection outlier change deviation detection identification unusual data records that might be interesting data errors that require further investigation Association rule learning dependency modeling Searches relationships between variables example supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits Using association rule learning supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together use this information marketing purposes This sometimes referred as market basket analysis Clustering task discovering groups structures in data that are in some way another similar without using known structures in data Classification task generalizing known structure apply new data example an e mail program might attempt classify an e mail as legitimate as spam Regression attempts find function which models data with least error that estimating relationships among data datasets Summarization providing more compact representation data set including visualization report generation Results validation edit An example data produced by data dredging through bot operated by statistician Tyler Vigen apparently showing close link between best word winning spelling bee competition number people in United States killed by venomous spiders similarity in trends obviously coincidence Data mining can unintentionally be misused can then produce results which appear be significant but which do not actually predict future behavior cannot be reproduced on new sample data bear little use Often this results from investigating many hypotheses not performing proper statistical hypothesis testing simple version this problem in machine learning known as overfitting but same problem can arise at different phases process thus train test split applicable at all may not be sufficient prevent this from happening This section missing information about non classification tasks in data mining It only covers machine learning Please expand section include this information Further details may exist on talk page September final step knowledge discovery from data verify that patterns produced by data mining algorithms occur in wider data set Not all patterns found by data mining algorithms are necessarily valid It common data mining algorithms find patterns in training set which are not present in general data set This called overfitting overcome this evaluation uses test set data on which data mining algorithm was not trained learned patterns are applied this test set resulting output compared desired output example data mining algorithm trying distinguish spam from legitimate emails would be trained on training set sample e mails Once trained learned patterns would be applied test set e mails on which it had not been trained accuracy patterns can then be measured from many e mails they correctly classify number statistical methods may be used evaluate algorithm such as ROC curves If learned patterns do not meet desired standards subsequently it necessary re evaluate change pre processing data mining steps If learned patterns do meet desired standards then final step interpret learned patterns turn them into knowledge Research edit premier professional body in field Association Computing Machinery s ACM Special Interest Group SIG on Knowledge Discovery Data Mining SIGKDD Since this ACM SIG has hosted an annual international conference published its proceedings since it has published biannual academic journal titled SIGKDD Explorations Computer science conferences on data mining include CIKM Conference ACM Conference on Information Knowledge Management European Conference on Machine Learning Principles Practice Knowledge Discovery in Databases KDD Conference ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery Data Mining Data mining topics are also present on many data management database conferences such as ICDE Conference SIGMOD Conference International Conference on Very Large Data Bases Standards edit have been some efforts define standards data mining process example European Cross Industry Standard Process Data Mining CRISP DM Java Data Mining standard JDM Development on successors these processes CRISP DM JDM was active in but has stalled since JDM was withdrawn without reaching final draft exchanging extracted models in particular use in predictive analytics key standard Predictive Model Markup Language PMML which an XML based language developed by Data Mining Group DMG supported as exchange format by many data mining applications As name suggests it only covers prediction models particular data mining task high importance business applications However extensions cover example subspace clustering have been proposed independently DMG Notable uses edit Main article Examples data mining See also Category Applied data mining Data mining used wherever digital data available today Notable examples data mining can be found throughout business medicine science surveillance Privacy concerns ethics edit While term data mining itself may have no ethical implications it often associated with mining information in relation peoples behavior ethical otherwise ways in which data mining can be used can in some cases contexts raise questions regarding privacy legality ethics In particular data mining government commercial data sets national security law enforcement purposes such as in Total Information Awareness Program in ADVISE has raised privacy concerns Data mining requires data preparation which uncovers information patterns which compromises confidentiality privacy obligations common way this occur through data aggregation Data aggregation involves combining data together possibly from various sources in way that facilitates analysis but that also might make identification private individual level data deducible otherwise apparent This not data mining per se but result preparation data before purposes analysis threat an individual s privacy comes into play data once compiled cause data miner anyone has access newly compiled data set be able identify specific individuals especially data were originally anonymous It recommended according whom be aware following before data are collected purpose data collection any known data mining projects data will be used will be able mine data use data derivatives status security surrounding access data collected data can be updated Data may also be modified so as become anonymous so that individuals may not readily be identified However even anonymized data sets can potentially contain enough information allow identification individuals as occurred journalists were able find several individuals based on set search histories that were inadvertently released by AOL inadvertent revelation personally identifiable information leading provider violates Fair Information Practices This indiscretion can cause financial emotional bodily harm indicated individual In one instance privacy violation patrons Walgreens filed lawsuit against company in selling prescription information data mining companies in turn provided data pharmaceutical companies Situation in Europe edit Europe has rather strong privacy laws efforts are underway further strengthen rights consumers However U S E U Safe Harbor Principles currently effectively expose European users privacy exploitation by U S companies As consequence Edward Snowden s global surveillance disclosure has been increased discussion revoke this agreement as in particular data will be fully exposed National Security Agency attempts reach an agreement have failed citation needed Situation in United States edit In United States privacy concerns have been addressed by US Congress via passage regulatory controls such as Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act HIPAA HIPAA requires individuals give informed consent regarding information they provide its intended present future uses According an article in Biotech Business Week i n practice HIPAA may not offer any greater protection than longstanding regulations in research arena says AAHC More importantly rule s goal protection through informed consent approach level incomprehensibility average individuals This underscores necessity data anonymity in data aggregation mining practices U S information privacy legislation such as HIPAA Family Educational Rights Privacy Act FERPA applies only specific areas that each such law addresses Use data mining by majority businesses in U S not controlled by any legislation Copyright law edit Situation in Europe edit Under European copyright database laws mining in copyright works such as by web mining without permission copyright owner not legal database pure data in Europe it may be that no copyright but database rights may exist so data mining becomes subject intellectual property owners rights that are protected by Database Directive On recommendation Hargreaves review this led UK government amend its copyright law in allow content mining as limitation exception UK was second country in world do so after Japan which introduced an exception in data mining However due restriction Information Society Directive UK exception only allows content mining non commercial purposes UK copyright law also does not allow this provision be overridden by contractual terms conditions European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text data mining in under title Licences Europe focus on solution this legal issue such as licensing rather than limitations exceptions led representatives universities researchers libraries civil society groups open access publishers leave stakeholder dialogue in May Situation in United States edit US copyright law in particular its provision fair use means that content mining in America as well as other fair use countries such as Israel Taiwan South Korea viewed as being legal As content mining transformative that it does not supplant original work it viewed as being lawful under fair use example as part Google Book settlement presiding judge on case ruled that Google s digitisation project in copyright books was lawful in
