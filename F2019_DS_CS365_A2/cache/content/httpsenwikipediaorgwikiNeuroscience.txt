nervous system dates ancient Egypt Trepanation surgical practice either drilling scraping hole into skull purpose curing head injuries mental disorders relieving cranial pressure was first recorded during Neolithic period Manuscripts dating BC indicate that Egyptians had some knowledge about symptoms brain damage Early views on function brain regarded it be cranial stuffing sorts In Egypt from late Middle Kingdom onwards brain was regularly removed in preparation mummification It was believed at time that heart was seat intelligence According Herodotus first step mummification was take crooked piece iron with it draw out brain through nostrils thus getting rid portion while skull cleared rest by rinsing with drugs view that heart was source consciousness was not challenged until time Greek physician Hippocrates He believed that brain was not only involved with sensation since most specialized organs e g eyes ears tongue are located in head near brain but was also seat intelligence Plato also speculated that brain was seat rational part soul Aristotle however believed heart was center intelligence that brain regulated amount heat from heart This view was generally accepted until Roman physician Galen follower Hippocrates physician Roman gladiators observed that his patients lost mental faculties they had sustained damage brains Abulcasis Averroes Avicenna Avenzoar Maimonides active in Medieval Muslim world described number medical problems related brain In Renaissance Europe Vesalius Ren Descartes Thomas Willis Jan Swammerdam also made several contributions neuroscience Golgi stain first allowed visualization individual neurons Luigi Galvani s pioneering work in late s set stage studying electrical excitability muscles neurons In first half th century Jean Pierre Flourens pioneered experimental method carrying out localized lesions brain in living animals describing effects on motricity sensibility behavior In Emil du Bois Reymond demonstrated electrical nature nerve signal whose speed Hermann von Helmholtz proceeded measure in Richard Caton found electrical phenomena in cerebral hemispheres rabbits monkeys Adolf Beck published in similar observations spontaneous electrical activity brain rabbits dogs Studies brain became more sophisticated after invention microscope development staining procedure by Camillo Golgi during late s procedure used silver chromate salt reveal intricate structures individual neurons His technique was used by Santiago Ram n y Cajal led formation neuron doctrine hypothesis that functional unit brain neuron Golgi Ram n y Cajal shared Nobel Prize in Physiology Medicine in extensive observations descriptions categorizations neurons throughout brain In parallel with this research work with brain damaged patients by Paul Broca suggested that certain regions brain were responsible certain functions At time Broca s findings were seen as confirmation Franz Joseph Gall s theory that language was localized that certain psychological functions were localized in specific areas cerebral cortex localization function hypothesis was supported by observations epileptic patients conducted by John Hughlings Jackson correctly inferred organization motor cortex by watching progression seizures through body Carl Wernicke further developed theory specialization specific brain structures in language comprehension production Modern research through neuroimaging techniques still uses Brodmann cerebral cytoarchitectonic map referring study cell structure anatomical definitions from this era in continuing show that distinct areas cortex are activated in execution specific tasks During th century neuroscience began be recognized as distinct academic discipline in its own right rather than as studies nervous system within other disciplines Eric Kandel collaborators have cited David Rioch Francis O Schmitt Stephen Kuffler as having played critical roles in establishing field Rioch originated integration basic anatomical physiological research with clinical psychiatry at Walter Reed Army Institute Research starting in s During same period Schmitt established neuroscience research program within Biology Department at Massachusetts Institute Technology bringing together biology chemistry physics mathematics first freestanding neuroscience department then called Psychobiology was founded in at University California Irvine by James L McGaugh This was followed by Department Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School which was founded in by Stephen Kuffler understanding neurons nervous system function became increasingly precise molecular during th century example in Alan Lloyd Hodgkin Andrew Huxley presented mathematical model transmission electrical signals in neurons giant axon squid which they called action potentials they are initiated propagated known as Hodgkin Huxley model In Richard FitzHugh J Nagumo simplified Hodgkin Huxley in called FitzHugh Nagumo model In Bernard Katz modeled neurotransmission across space between neurons known as synapses Beginning in Eric Kandel collaborators examined biochemical changes in neurons associated with learning memory storage in Aplysia In Catherine Morris Harold Lecar combined these models in Morris Lecar model Such increasingly quantitative work gave rise numerous biological neuron models models neural computation As result increasing interest about nervous system several prominent neuroscience organizations have been formed provide forum all neuroscientist during th century example International Brain Research Organization was founded in International Society Neurochemistry in European Brain Behaviour Society in Society Neuroscience in Recently application neuroscience research results has also given rise applied disciplines as neuroeconomics neuroeducation neuroethics neurolaw Over time brain research has gone through philosophical experimental theoretical phases with work on brain simulation predicted be important in future Modern neuroscience edit Main article Outline neuroscience Human nervous system scientific study nervous system increased significantly during second half twentieth century principally due advances in molecular biology electrophysiology computational neuroscience This has allowed neuroscientists study nervous system in all its aspects it structured it works it develops it malfunctions it can be changed example it has become possible understand in much detail complex processes occurring within single neuron Neurons are cells specialized communication They are able communicate with neurons other cell types through specialized junctions called synapses at which electrical electrochemical signals can be transmitted from one cell another Many neurons extrude long thin filament axoplasm called an axon which may extend distant parts body are capable rapidly carrying electrical signals influencing activity other neurons muscles glands at termination points nervous system emerges from assemblage neurons that are connected each other vertebrate nervous system can be split into two parts central nervous system defined as brain spinal cord peripheral nervous system In many species including all vertebrates nervous system most complex organ system in body with most complexity residing in brain human brain alone contains around one hundred billion neurons one hundred trillion synapses it consists thousands distinguishable substructures connected each other in synaptic networks whose intricacies have only begun be unraveled At least one out three approximately genes belonging human genome expressed mainly in brain Due high degree plasticity human brain structure its synapses resulting functions change throughout life Making sense nervous system s dynamic complexity formidable research challenge Ultimately neuroscientists would like understand every aspect nervous system including it works it develops it malfunctions it can be altered repaired Analysis nervous system therefore performed at multiple levels ranging from molecular cellular levels systems cognitive levels specific topics that
