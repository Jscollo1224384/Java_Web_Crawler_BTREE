neuroscientific group researchers As social science it aims understand individuals groups by establishing general principles researching specific cases In this field professional practitioner researcher called psychologist can be classified as social behavioral cognitive scientist Psychologists attempt understand role mental functions in individual social behavior while also exploring physiological biological processes that underlie cognitive functions behaviors Psychologists explore behavior mental processes including perception cognition attention emotion intelligence subjective experiences motivation brain functioning personality This extends interaction between people such as interpersonal relationships including psychological resilience family resilience other areas Psychologists diverse orientations also consider unconscious mind Psychologists employ empirical methods infer causal correlational relationships between psychosocial variables In addition in opposition employing empirical deductive methods some especially clinical counseling psychologists at times rely upon symbolic interpretation other inductive techniques Psychology has been described as hub science in that medicine tends draw psychological research via neurology psychiatry whereas social sciences most commonly draws directly from sub disciplines within psychology While psychological knowledge often applied assessment treatment mental health problems it also directed towards understanding solving problems in several spheres human activity By many accounts psychology ultimately aims benefit society majority psychologists are involved in some kind therapeutic role practicing in clinical counseling school settings Many do scientific research on wide range topics related mental processes behavior typically work in university psychology departments teach in other academic settings e g medical schools hospitals Some are employed in industrial organizational

Latinist Marko Maruli in his book Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae in late th century early th century earliest known reference word psychology in English was by Steven Blankaart in in Physical Dictionary which refers Anatomy which treats Body Psychology which treats Soul In William James defined psychology as science mental life both its phenomena conditions This definition enjoyed widespread currency decades However this meaning was contested notably by radical behaviorists such as John B Watson in his manifesto defined discipline psychology as acquisition information useful control behavior Also since James defined it term more strongly connotes techniques scientific experimentation Folk psychology refers understanding ordinary people as contrasted with that psychology professionals History Main article History psychology ancient civilizations Egypt Greece China India Persia all engaged in philosophical study psychology In Ancient Egypt Ebers Papyrus mentioned depression thought disorders Historians note that Greek philosophers including Thales Plato Aristotle especially in his De Anima treatise addressed workings mind As early as th century BC Greek physician Hippocrates theorized that mental disorders had physical rather than supernatural causes In China psychological understanding grew from philosophical works Laozi Confucius later from doctrines Buddhism This body knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection observation as well as techniques focused thinking acting It frames universe as division interaction between physical reality mental reality with an emphasis on purifying mind in order increase virtue power An ancient text known as Yellow Emperor s Classic Internal Medicine identifies brain as nexus wisdom sensation includes theories personality based on yin yang balance analyzes mental disorder in terms physiological social disequilibria Chinese scholarship focused on brain advanced in Qing Dynasty with work Western educated Fang Yizhi Liu Zhi Wang Qingren Wang Qingren emphasized importance brain as center nervous system linked mental disorder with brain diseases investigated causes dreams insomnia advanced theory hemispheric lateralization in brain function Distinctions in types awareness appear in ancient thought India influenced by Hinduism central idea Upanishads distinction between person s transient mundane self eternal unchanging soul Divergent Hindu doctrines Buddhism have challenged this hierarchy selves but have all emphasized importance reaching higher awareness Yoga range techniques used in pursuit this goal Much Sanskrit corpus was suppressed under British East India Company followed by British Raj in s However Indian doctrines influenced Western thinking via Theosophical Society New Age group which became popular among Euro American intellectuals Psychology was popular topic in Enlightenment Europe In Germany Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz applied his principles calculus mind arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum most notably that among an infinity human perceptions desires difference between conscious unconscious awareness only matter degree Christian Wolff identified psychology as its own science writing Psychologia empirica in Psychologia rationalis in This notion advanced further under Immanuel Kant established idea anthropology with psychology as an important subdivision However Kant explicitly notoriously rejected idea experimental psychology writing that empirical doctrine soul can also never approach chemistry even as systematic art analysis experimental doctrine in it manifold inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought cannot then be held separate recombined at will but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself be experimented upon suit our purpose even observation by itself already changes displaces state observed object In Ferdinand Ueberwasser designated himself Professor Empirical Psychology Logic gave lectures on scientific psychology though these developments were soon overshadowed by Napoleonic Wars after which Old University M nster was discontinued by Prussian authorities Having consulted philosophers Hegel Herbart however in Prussian state established psychology as mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding highly influential educational system However this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation In England early psychology involved phrenology response social problems including alcoholism violence country s well populated mental asylums Beginning experimental psychology Wilhelm Wundt seated with colleagues in his psychological laboratory first its kind Gustav Fechner began conducting psychophysics research in Leipzig in s articulating principle Weber Fechner law that human perception stimulus varies logarithmically according its intensity Fechner s Elements Psychophysics challenged Kant s stricture against quantitative study mind In Heidelberg Hermann von Helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception trained physiologist Wilhelm Wundt Wundt in turn came Leipzig University establishing psychological laboratory which brought experimental psychology world Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into most basic components motivated in part by an analogy recent advances in chemistry its successful investigation elements structure material Paul Flechsig Emil Kraepelin soon created another influential psychology laboratory at Leipzig this one focused on more on experimental psychiatry Psychologists in Germany Denmark Austria England United States soon followed Wundt in setting up laboratories G Stanley Hall studied with Wundt formed psychology lab at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland which became internationally influential Hall in turn trained Yujiro Motora brought experimental psychology emphasizing psychophysics Imperial University Tokyo Wundt s assistant Hugo M nsterberg taught psychology at Harvard students such as Narendra Nath Sen Gupta in founded psychology department laboratory at University Calcutta Wundt students Walter Dill Scott Lightner Witmer James McKeen Cattell worked on developing tests mental ability Catell also studied with eugenicist Francis Galton went on found Psychological Corporation Wittmer focused on mental testing children Scott on selection employees Another student Wundt Edward Titchener created psychology program at Cornell University advanced doctrine structuralist psychology Structuralism sought analyze classify different aspects mind primarily through method introspection William James John Dewey Harvey Carr advanced more expansive doctrine called functionalism attuned more human environment actions In James wrote an influential book Principles Psychology which expanded on realm structuralism memorably described human stream

cultural institutions in military An especial focus was pedology study child development regarding which Lev Vygotsky became prominent writer Bolsheviks also promoted free love embraced doctrine psychoanalysis as an antidote sexual repression Although pedology intelligence testing fell out favor in psychology maintained its privileged position as an instrument Soviet Union Stalinist purges

Ivan Pavlov posthumously Stalin himself were aggrandized as heroes Soviet psychology Soviet academics was speedily liberalized during Khrushchev Thaw cybernetics linguistics genetics other topics became acceptable again emerged new field called engineering psychology which studied mental aspects complex jobs such as pilot cosmonaut Interdisciplinary studies became popular scholars such as Georgy Shchedrovitsky developed systems theory approaches human behavior Twentieth century Chinese psychology originally modeled U S with translations from American authors like William James

governments legally regulate can provide psychological services represent themselves as psychologist APA defines psychologist as someone with doctoral degree in psychology Boundaries Early practitioners experimental psychology distinguished themselves from parapsychology which in late nineteenth century enjoyed great popularity including interest scholars such as William James indeed constituted bulk people called psychology Parapsychology hypnotism psychism were major topics early International Congresses But students these fields were eventually ostractized more less banished from Congress in Parapsychology persisted time at Imperial University with publications such as Clairvoyance Thoughtography by Tomokichi Fukurai but here it was mostly shunned by As discipline psychology has long sought fend off accusations that it soft science Philosopher science Thomas Kuhn s critique implied psychology overall was in pre paradigm state lacking agreement on overarching theory found in mature sciences such as chemistry physics some areas psychology rely on research methods such as surveys questionnaires critics asserted that psychology not an objective science Skeptics have suggested that personality thinking emotion cannot be directly measured are often inferred from subjective self reports which may be problematic Experimental psychologists have devised variety ways indirectly measure these elusive phenomenological entities Divisions still exist within field with some psychologists more oriented towards unique experiences individual humans which cannot be understood only as data points within larger population Critics inside outside field have argued that mainstream psychology has become increasingly dominated by cult empiricism which limits scope its study by using only methods derived from physical sciences Feminist critiques along these lines have argued that claims scientific objectivity obscure values agenda historically mostly male

interface mind body Biological psychology also known as physiological psychology neuropsychology study biological substrates behavior mental processes Key research topics in this field include comparative psychology which studies humans in relation other animals perception which involves physical mechanics sensation as well as neural mental processing centuries leading question in biological psychology has been whether mental functions might be localized in brain From Phineas Gage H M Clive Wearing individual people with mental issues traceable physical damage have inspired new discoveries in this area Modern neuropsychology could be said originate in s in France Paul Broca traced production speech left frontal gyrus thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization brain function Soon after Carl Wernicke identified related area necessary understanding speech contemporary field behavioral neuroscience focuses on physical causes underpinning behavior example physiological psychologists use animal models typically rats study neural genetic cellular mechanisms that underlie specific behaviors such as learning memory fear responses Cognitive neuroscientists investigate neural correlates psychological processes in humans using neural imaging tools neuropsychologists conduct psychological assessments determine instance specific aspects extent cognitive deficit caused by brain damage disease biopsychosocial model an integrated perspective toward understanding consciousness behavior social interaction It assumes that any given behavior mental process affects affected by dynamically interrelated biological psychological social factors Evolutionary psychology examines cognition personality traits from an evolutionary perspective This perspective suggests that psychological adaptations evolved solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments Evolutionary psychology offers complementary explanations mostly proximate developmental explanations developed by other areas psychology that it focuses mostly on ultimate questions rather than proximate questions questions are more directly tackled by behavioral genetics research which aims understand genes environment impact behavior search biological origins psychological phenomena has long involved debates about importance race especially relationship between race intelligence idea white supremacy indeed modern concept race itself arose during process world conquest by Europeans Carl von Linnaeus s four fold classification humans classifies Europeans as intelligent severe Americans as contented free Asians as ritualistic Africans as lazy capricious Race was also used justify construction socially specific mental disorders such as drapetomania dysaesthesia aethiopica

Behavioral research ever aspires improve effectiveness techniques behavior modification Play media film Little Albert experiment Early behavioral researchers studied stimulus response pairings now known as classical conditioning They demonstrated that behaviors could be linked through repeated association with stimuli eliciting pain pleasure Ivan Pavlov known best inducing dogs salivate in presence stimulus previously linked with food became leading figure in Soviet Union inspired followers use his methods on humans In United States Edward Lee Thorndike initiated connectionism studies by trapping animals in puzzle boxes rewarding them escaping Thorndike wrote in can be no moral warrant studying man s nature unless study will enable us control his acts From American Psychological Association went through sea change opinion away from mentalism towards behavioralism in John B Watson coined term behaviorism this school thought Watson s famous Little Albert experiment in demonstrated that repeated use upsetting loud noises could instill phobias aversions other stimuli in an infant human Karl Lashley close collaborator with Watson examined biological manifestations learning in brain Embraced extended by Clark L Hull Edwin Guthrie others behaviorism became widely used research paradigm new method instrumental operant conditioning added concepts reinforcement punishment model behavior change Radical behaviorists avoided discussing inner workings mind especially unconscious mind which they considered impossible assess scientifically Operant conditioning was first described by Miller Kanorski popularized in U S by B F Skinner emerged as leading intellectual behaviorist movement Noam Chomsky delivered an influential critique radical behaviorism on grounds that it could not adequately explain complex mental process language acquisition Martin Seligman colleagues discovered that conditioning dogs led outcomes learned helplessness that opposed predictions behaviorism Skinner s behaviorism did not die perhaps in part it generated successful practical applications Edward C Tolman advanced hybrid cognitive behaviorial model most notably with his

psychotherapy treat psychological emotional distress especially conflict originating in unconscious mind This school thought originated in s with Austrian medical doctors including Josef Breuer physician Alfred Adler physician Otto Rank psychoanalyst most prominently Sigmund Freud neurologist Freud s psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods introspection clinical observations It became very well known largely it tackled subjects such as sexuality repression unconscious These subjects were largely taboo at time Freud provided catalyst open discussion in polite society Clinically Freud helped pioneer method free association therapeutic interest in dream interpretation Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung influenced by Freud elaborated theory collective unconscious primordial force present in all humans featuring archetypes which exerted profound influence on mind Jung s competing vision formed basis analytical psychology which later led archetypal process oriented schools Other well known psychoanalytic scholars mid th century include Erik Erikson Melanie Klein D W Winnicott Karen Horney Erich Fromm John Bowlby Sigmund Freud s daughter Anna Freud Throughout th century psychoanalysis evolved into diverse schools thought which could be called Neo Freudian Among these schools are ego psychology object relations interpersonal Lacanian relational psychoanalysis citation needed Psychologists such as Hans Eysenck philosophers including Karl Popper criticized psychoanalysis Popper argued that psychoanalysis had been misrepresented as scientific discipline whereas Eysenck said that psychoanalytic tenets had been contradicted by experimental data By end th century psychology departments in American universities mostly marginalized Freudian theory dismissing it as desiccated dead historical artifact However researchers in emerging field neuro psychoanalysis today defend some Freud s ideas on scientific grounds while scholars humanities

provide subjective introspective responses hundreds items pertaining psychopathology Unconscious mind See also Unconscious mind Psychology Study unconscious mind part psyche outside awareness individual which nevertheless influenced thoughts behavior was hallmark early psychology In one first psychology experiments conducted in United States C S Peirce Joseph Jastrow found in that subjects could choose minutely heavier two weights even if consciously uncertain difference Freud popularized this concept with terms like Freudian slip entering popular culture mean an uncensored intrusion unconscious thought into one s speech action His text Psychopathology Everyday Life catalogues hundreds everyday events which Freud explains in terms unconscious influence Pierre Janet advanced idea subconscious mind which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable scrutiny subject Behaviorism notwithstanding unconscious mind has maintained its importance in psychology Cognitive psychologists have used filter model attention according which much information processing takes place below threshold consciousness only certain processes limited by nature by simultaneous quantity make way through filter Copious research has shown that subconscious priming certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts behavior significant hurdle in this research proving that subject s conscious mind has not grasped certain stimulus due unreliability self reporting this reason some psychologists prefer distinguish between implicit explicit memory In another approach one can also describe subliminal stimulus as meeting an objective but not subjective threshold automaticity model which became widespread following exposition by John Bargh others in s describes sophisticated processes executing goals which can be selected performed over an extended duration without conscious awareness Some experimental data suggests that brain begins consider taking actions before mind becomes aware them This influence unconscious forces on people s choices naturally bears on philosophical questions free will John Bargh Daniel Wegner Ellen Langer are some prominent contemporary psychologists describe free will as an illusion Motivation Main article Motivation Psychologists such as William James initially used term motivation refer intention in sense similar concept will in European philosophy With steady rise Darwinian Freudian thinking instinct also came be seen as primary source motivation According drive theory forces instinct combine into single source energy which exerts constant influence Psychoanalysis like biology regarded these forces as physical demands made by organism on nervous system However they believed that these forces especially sexual instincts could become entangled transmuted within psyche Classical psychoanalysis conceives struggle between pleasure principle reality principle roughly corresponding id ego Later in Beyond Pleasure Principle Freud introduced concept death drive compulsion towards aggression destruction psychic repetition traumatic events Meanwhile behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models pleasure pain reward punishment well established principles such as idea that thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking Clark Hull formalized latter idea with his drive reduction model Hunger thirst fear sexual desire thermoregulation all seem constitute fundamental motivations animals Humans also seem exhibit more complex set motivations though theoretically these could be explained as resulting from primordial instincts including desires belonging self image self consistency truth love control Motivation can be modulated manipulated in many different ways Researchers have found that eating example depends not only on organism s fundamental need homeostasis an important factor causing experience hunger but also on circadian rhythms food availability food palatability cost Abstract motivations are also malleable as evidenced by such phenomena as goal contagion adoption goals sometimes unconsciously based on inferences about goals others Vohs Baumeister suggest that contrary need desire fulfilment cycle animal instincts human motivations sometimes obey getting begets wanting rule more get reward such as self esteem love drugs money more want it They suggest that this principle can even apply food drink sex sleep Development Main article Developmental psychology Developmental psychologists would engage child with book then make observations based on child interacts with object Mainly focusing on development human mind through life span developmental psychology seeks understand people come perceive understand act within world these processes change as they age This may focus on cognitive affective moral social neural development Researchers study children use number unique research methods make observations in natural settings engage them in experimental tasks Such tasks often resemble specially designed games activities that are both enjoyable child scientifically useful researchers have even devised clever methods study mental processes infants In addition studying children developmental psychologists also study aging processes throughout life span especially at other times rapid change such as adolescence old age Developmental psychologists draw on full range psychological theories inform research citation needed Genes environment Main article Behavioral genetics All researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes environment varying degrees These two sources influence are often confounded in observational research individuals families An example transmission depression from depressed mother her offspring Theory may hold that offspring by virtue having depressed mother in his her offspring s environment at risk developing depression However risk depression also influenced some extent by genes mother may both carry genes that contribute her depression but will also have passed those genes on her offspring thus increasing offspring s risk depression Genes environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded Experimental quasi experimental behavioral genetic research uses genetic methodologies disentangle this confound understand nature origins individual differences in behavior Traditionally this research has been conducted using twin studies adoption studies two designs genetic environmental influences can be partially un confounded More recently availability microarray molecular genetic genome sequencing technologies allows researchers measure participant DNA variation directly test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits psychopathology through methods including genome wide association studies One goal such research similar that in positional cloning its success in Huntington s once causal gene discovered biological research can be conducted understand that gene influences phenotype One major result genetic association studies general finding that psychological traits psychopathology as well as complex medical diseases are highly polygenic large number on order hundreds thousands genetic variants each small effect contribute individual differences in behavioral trait propensity disorder

mental problems part some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis other forms psychodynamic psychotherapy understand treat mentally ill In this type treatment specially trained therapist develops close relationship with patient discusses wishes dreams social relationships other aspects mental life therapist seeks uncover repressed material understand patient creates defenses

now including cognitive constructs which had gained popularity in theoretical psychology key practice in behavioral cognitive behavioral therapy exposing patients things they fear based on premise that responses fear panic anxiety can be deconditioned Mental health care today involves psychologists social workers in increasing numbers In National Institute Mental Health director Bertram Brown described this shift as source intense competition role confusion Graduate programs issuing doctorates in psychology PsyD emerged in s underwent rapid increase through s This degree intended train practitioners might conduct scientific research Some clinical psychologists may focus on clinical management patients with brain injury this area known as clinical neuropsychology In many countries clinical psychology regulated mental health profession emerging field disaster psychology see crisis intervention involves professionals respond large scale traumatic events work performed by clinical psychologists tends be influenced by various therapeutic approaches all which involve formal relationship between professional client usually an individual couple family small group Typically these approaches encourage new ways thinking feeling behaving Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic cognitive behavioral existential humanistic systems family therapy has been growing movement integrate various therapeutic approaches especially with an increased understanding issues regarding culture gender spirituality sexual orientation With advent more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy evidence that most major therapies have equal effectiveness with key common element being strong therapeutic alliance this more training programs psychologists are now adopting

placebos especially with regard helping people with body image problems Research methods Main articles Psychological research List psychological research methods Quantitative psychological research lends itself statistical testing hypotheses Although field makes abundant use randomized controlled experiments in laboratory settings such research can only assess limited range short term phenomena Thus psychologists also rely on creative statistical methods glean knowledge from clinical trials population data These include Pearson product moment correlation coefficient analysis variance multiple linear regression logistic regression structural equation modeling hierarchical linear modeling measurement operationalization important constructs an essential part these research designs Controlled experiments Main article Experiment Flowchart four phases enrollment intervention allocation follow up data analysis parallel randomized trial two groups modified from CONSORT Statement experimenter E orders teacher T subject experiment give latter believes are painful electric shocks learner L actually an actor confederate subject believes that each wrong answer learner was receiving actual electric shocks though in reality were no such punishments Being separated from subject confederate set up tape recorder integrated with electro shock generator which played pre recorded sounds each shock level etc true experiment with random allocation subjects conditions allows researchers make strong inferences about causal relationships In an experiment researcher alters parameters influence called independent variables measures resulting changes interest called dependent variables Prototypical experimental research conducted in laboratory with carefully controlled environment Repeated measures experiments are those which take place through intervention on multiple occasions In research on effectiveness psychotherapy experimenters often compare given treatment with placebo treatments compare different treatments against each other Treatment type independent variable dependent variables are outcomes ideally assessed in several ways by different professionals Using crossover design researchers can further increase strength results by testing both two treatments on two groups subjects Quasi experimental design refers especially situations precluding random assignment different conditions Researchers can use common sense consider much nonrandom assignment threatens study s validity example in research on best way affect reading achievement in first three grades school school administrators may not permit educational psychologists randomly assign children phonics whole language classrooms in which case psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments Psychologists will compare achievement children attending phonics whole language classes Experimental researchers typically use statistical hypothesis testing model which involves making predictions before conducting experiment then assessing well data supports predictions These predictions may originate from more abstract scientific hypothesis about phenomenon under study actually works Analysis variance ANOVA statistical techniques are used distinguish unique results experiment from null hypothesis that variations result from random fluctuations in data In psychology widely used standard ascribes statistical significance results which have less than probability being explained by random variation Other forms statistical inference Statistical surveys are used in psychology measuring attitudes traits monitoring changes in mood checking validity experimental manipulations other psychological topics Most commonly psychologists use paper pencil surveys However surveys are also conducted over phone through e mail Web based surveys are increasingly used conveniently reach many subjects Neuropsychological tests such as Wechsler scales Wisconsin Card Sorting Test are mostly questionnaires simple tasks used which assess specific type mental function in respondent These can be used in experiments as in case lesion experiments evaluating results damage specific part brain Observational studies analyze uncontrolled data in search correlations multivariate statistics are typically used interpret more complex situation Cross sectional observational studies use data from single point in time whereas longitudinal studies are used study trends across life span Longitudinal studies track same people therefore detect more individual rather than cultural differences However they suffer from lack controls from confounding factors such as selective attrition bias introduced certain type subject disproportionately leaves study Exploratory data analysis refers variety practices which researchers can use visualize analyze existing sets data In Peirce s three modes inference exploratory data analysis corresponds abduction hypothesis formation Meta analysis technique integrating results from multiple studies interpreting statistical properties pooled dataset Technological assays An EEG recording setup classic popular tool used relate mental neural activity electroencephalogram EEG technique using amplified electrodes on person s scalp measure voltage changes in different parts brain Hans Berger first researcher use EEG on an unopened skull quickly found that brains exhibit signature brain waves electric oscillations which correspond different states consciousness Researchers subsequently refined statistical methods synthesizing electrode data identified unique brain wave patterns such as delta wave observed during non REM sleep Newer functional neuroimaging techniques include functional magnetic resonance imaging positron emission tomography both which track flow blood through brain These technologies provide more localized information about activity in brain create representations brain with widespread appeal They also provide insight which avoids classic problems subjective self reporting It remains challenging draw hard conclusions about in brain specific thoughts originate even usefully such localization corresponds with reality However neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing existence correlations between mind brain Some these draw on systemic neural network model rather than localized function model Psychiatric interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation drugs also provide information about brain mind interactions Psychopharmacology study drug induced mental effects Artificial neural network with two layers an interconnected group nodes akin vast network neurons in human brain Computer simulation See also Computational cognition Computational modeling tool used in mathematical psychology cognitive psychology simulate behavior This method has several advantages Since modern computers process information quickly simulations can be run in short time allowing high statistical power Modeling also allows psychologists visualize hypotheses about functional organization mental events that couldn t be directly observed in human Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models simulate brain Another method symbolic modeling which represents many mental objects using variables rules Other types modeling include dynamic systems stochastic modeling Animal studies rat undergoing Morris water navigation test used in behavioral neuroscience study role hippocampus in spatial learning memory Animal experiments aid in investigating many aspects human psychology including perception emotion learning memory thought name few In s Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs demonstrate classical conditioning Non human primates cats dogs pigeons rats other rodents are often used in psychological experiments Ideally controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at time in order ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings In contrast human environments genetic backgrounds vary so widely depend upon so many factors that it difficult control important variables human subjects are pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies humans through animal models Comparative psychology refers scientific study behavior mental processes non human animals especially as these relate phylogenetic history adaptive significance development behavior Research in this area explores behavior many species from insects primates It closely related other disciplines that study animal behavior such as ethology Research in comparative psychology sometimes appears shed light on human behavior but some attempts connect two have been quite controversial example Sociobiology E O Wilson Animal models are often used study neural processes related human behavior e g in cognitive neuroscience Qualitative descriptive research Research designed answer questions about current state affairs such as thoughts feelings behaviors individuals known as descriptive research Descriptive research can be qualitative quantitative in orientation Qualitative research descriptive research that focused on observing describing events as they occur with goal capturing all richness everyday behavior with hope discovering understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made Qualitative psychological research methods include interviews first hand observation participant observation Creswell identifies five main possibilities qualitative research including narrative phenomenology ethnography case study grounded theory Qualitative researchers sometimes aim enrich interpretations critiques symbols subjective experiences social structures Sometimes hermeneutic critical aims can give rise quantitative research as in Erich Fromm s study Nazi voting citation needed Stanley Milgram s studies obedience authority Phineas P Gage survived an accident in which large iron rod was driven completely through his head destroying much his brain s left frontal lobe remembered that injury s reported effects on his personality behavior Just as Jane Goodall studied chimpanzee social family life by careful observation chimpanzee behavior in field psychologists conduct naturalistic observation ongoing human social professional family life Sometimes participants are aware they are being observed other times participants do not know they are being observed Strict ethical guidelines must be followed covert observation being carried out Program Evaluation Program Evaluation systematic method collecting analyzing using information answer questions about projects policies programs particularly about effectiveness efficiency In both public private sectors stakeholders often want know whether programs they are funding implementing voting receiving objecting are producing intended effect While program evaluation first focuses around this definition important considerations often include much program costs per participant program could be improved whether program worthwhile whether are better alternatives if are unintended outcomes whether program goals are appropriate useful Contemporary issues in methodology practice Metascience field metascience has revealed significant problems with methodology psychological research Psychological research suffers from high bias low reproducibility widespread misuse use statistics These finding have led calls reform from within from outside scientific community Confirmation bias In statistician Theodore Sterling examined results psychological studies discovered that them supported initial hypotheses implying possible publication bias Similarly Fanelli found that psychiatry psychology studies confirmed effects they were looking concluded that odds this happening positive result was around five times higher than in fields such as space geosciences Fanelli argues that this researchers in softer sciences have fewer constraints conscious unconscious biases Replication Further information Replication crisis In psychology Over subsequent few years replication crisis in psychology was identified it was publicly noted that many notable findings in field had not been replicated with some researchers being accused outright fraud in results More systematic efforts assess extent problem such as Reproducibility Project Center Open Science found that as many as two thirds highly publicized findings in psychology had failed be replicated with reproducibility being generally stronger in studies journals representing cognitive psychology than social psychology topics subfields personality psychology behavioral genetics related field behavioral economics being largely unaffected by replication crisis with exception candidate gene candidate gene by environment interaction research on behavior mental illness in behavioral genetics Other subfields psychology that have been implicated by replication crisis are clinical psychology developmental psychology field closely related psychology that has also been implicated educational research Focus on replication crisis has led other renewed efforts in discipline re test important findings in response concerns about publication bias p hacking more than psychology journals have adopted result blind peer review studies are accepted not on basis findings after studies are completed but before studies are conducted upon basis methodological rigor experimental designs theoretical justifications statistical analysis techniques before data collection analysis done In addition large scale collaborations between researchers working in multiple labs in different countries that regularly make data openly available different researchers assess have become much more common in field Early analysis such reforms has estimated that percent result blind studies have led null results in contrast an estimated percent in earlier research Misuse statistics Further information Misuse statistics Misuse p values Some critics view statistical hypothesis testing as misplaced Psychologist statistician Jacob Cohen wrote in that psychologists routinely confuse statistical significance with practical importance enthusiastically reporting great certainty in unimportant facts Some psychologists have responded with an increased use effect size statistics rather than sole reliance on p values citation needed WEIRD bias WEIRD redirects here other uses see Weird In Arnett pointed out that most articles in American Psychological Association journals were about US populations U S citizens are only world s population He complained that psychologists had no basis assuming psychological processes be universal generalizing research findings rest global population In Henrich Heine Norenzayan reported systemic bias in conducting psychology studies with participants from WEIRD western educated industrialized rich democratic societies Although only people worldwide live in regions that fall into WEIRD classification researchers claimed that psychology studies are performed on participants from these areas article gave examples results that differ significantly between people from WEIRD tribal cultures including M ller Lyer illusion Arnett Altmaier Hall Morgan Consoli et al saw Western bias in research theory as serious problem considering psychologists are increasingly applying psychological principles developed in WEIRD regions in research clinical work consultation with populations around world In Rad Martingano Ginges showed that nearly decade after Henrich et al s paper over samples used in studies published in journal Psychological Science were from WEIRD population Moreover analysis showed that several studies did not fully disclose origin samples authors offer set recommendations editors reviewers

do not instill scientific competence Practices such as facilitated communication infantile autism memory recovery techniques including body work other therapies such as rebirthing reparenting may be dubious even dangerous despite popularity In Allen Neuringer made similar point vague regarding experimental analysis behavior Psychologists sometimes divided along lines laboratory vs clinic continue debate these issues Ethics Ethical standards in discipline have changed over time Some famous past studies are today considered unethical in violation established codes Canadian Code Conduct Research Involving Humans Belmont Report most important contemporary standards are informed voluntary consent After World War II Nuremberg Code was established Nazi abuses experimental subjects Later most

Members public have five year window file ethics complaints about APA members with APA ethics committee members APA have three year window Some ethical issues considered most important are requirement practice only within area competence maintain confidentiality with patients avoid sexual relations with them Another important principle informed consent idea that patient research subject must understand freely choose procedure they are undergoing Some most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct involvement in child custody evaluations Other animals Current ethical guidelines state that using non human animals scientific purposes only acceptable harm physical psychological done animals outweighed by benefits research Keeping this in mind psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans An experiment by Stanley Milgram raised questions about ethics scientific experimentation extreme emotional stress suffered by participants It measured willingness study participants obey an authority figure instructed them perform acts that conflicted with personal conscience Comparative psychologist Harry Harlow drew moral condemnation isolation experiments on rhesus macaque monkeys at University Wisconsin Madison in s aim research was produce an animal model clinical depression Harlow also devised he called rape rack which female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture In American literary critic Wayne C Booth wrote that Harry Harlow his colleagues go on torturing
