publicist denied this following Annakin s death in Anakin Luke s original surname Starkiller remained in script until few months into filming Star Wars it was dropped due Lucas called unpleasant connotations with Charles Manson replaced with Skywalker c Concept writing In first draft Star Wars tall grim general Darth Vader was already close in line with his final depiction protagonist Annikin Starkiller had role similar that his son Luke s as year old son respected warrior Originally Lucas conceived Sith as group that served Emperor in same way that Schutzstaffel served Adolf Hitler In

with him They held story conferences by late November Lucas had produced handwritten treatment In first draft that Brackett would write from this Luke s father appears as ghost instruct Luke Lucas was disappointed with script but Brackett died cancer before he could discuss it with her With no writer available Lucas wrote next draft himself In this draft dated April he made use new plot twist Vader claiming be Luke s father According Lucas he found this draft enjoyable write as opposed year long struggles writing first film new plot element Luke s parentage had drastic effects on series Author

long story that started with Anakin s childhood ended with his death This was final step towards turning film series into saga first prequel Episode Phantom Menace Lucas made Anakin nine years old d make character s separation from his mother poignant Movie trailers focused on Anakin one sheet poster showing him casting Vader s shadow informed otherwise unknowing audiences character s eventual fate movie ultimately achieved primary goal introducing audiences Anakin Author Michael Kaminski in Secret History Star Wars offers evidence that issues in Anakin s fall dark side prompted Lucas make massive story changes first revising opening sequence third prequel Revenge Sith have Palpatine kidnapped his apprentice Count Dooku killed by Anakin in cold blood as first act in latter s turn towards dark side After principal photography was complete in Lucas made even more massive changes in Anakin s character re writing his entire turn dark side Anakin s fall from grace would now be
