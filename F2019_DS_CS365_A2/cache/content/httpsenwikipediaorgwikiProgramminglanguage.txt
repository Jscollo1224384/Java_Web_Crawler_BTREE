Programming language Wikipedia Programming language From Wikipedia free encyclopedia This latest accepted revision reviewed on November Jump navigation Jump search Language designed communicate instructions machine source code simple computer program written in C programming language compiled run it will give output Hello world programming language formal language which comprises set instructions that produce various kinds output Programming languages are used in computer programming implement algorithms Most programming languages consist instructions computers are programmable machines that use set specific instructions rather than general programming languages Early ones preceded invention digital computer first probably being automatic flute player described in th century by brothers Musa in Baghdad during Islamic Golden Age Since early s programs have been used direct behavior machines such as Jacquard looms music boxes player pianos programs these machines such as player piano s scrolls did not produce different behavior in response different inputs conditions Thousands different programming languages have been created more are being created every year Many programming languages are written in an imperative form i e as sequence operations perform while other languages use declarative form i e desired result specified not achieve it description programming language usually split into two components syntax form semantics meaning Some languages are defined by specification document example C programming language specified by an ISO Standard while other languages such as Perl have dominant implementation that treated as reference Some languages have both with basic language defined by standard extensions taken from dominant implementation

implementations Taxonomies See also References Further reading External links Definitions edit programming language notation writing programs which are specifications computation algorithm Some authors restrict term programming language those languages that can express all possible algorithms Traits often considered important constitutes programming language include Function target computer programming language language used write computer programs which involves computer performing some kind computation algorithm possibly control external devices such as printers disk drives robots so on example PostScript programs are frequently created by another program control computer printer display More generally programming language may describe computation on some possibly abstract machine It generally accepted that complete specification programming language includes description possibly idealized machine processor that language In most practical contexts programming language involves computer consequently programming languages are usually defined studied this way Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used interaction between people while programming languages also allow humans communicate instructions machines Abstractions Programming languages usually contain abstractions defining manipulating data structures controlling flow execution practical necessity that programming language support adequate abstractions expressed by abstraction principle This principle sometimes formulated as recommendation programmer make proper use such abstractions Expressive power theory computation classifies languages by computations they are capable expressing All Turing complete languages can implement same set algorithms ANSI ISO SQL Charity are examples languages that are not Turing complete yet often called programming languages Markup languages like XML HTML troff which define structured data are not usually considered programming languages Programming languages may however share syntax with markup languages if computational semantics defined XSLT example Turing complete language entirely using XML syntax Moreover LaTeX which mostly used structuring documents also contains Turing complete subset term computer language sometimes used interchangeably with programming language However usage both terms varies among authors including exact scope each One usage describes programming languages as subset computer languages Similarly languages used in computing that have different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages instance markup languages are sometimes referred as computer languages emphasize that they are not meant be used programming Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs programming abstract machines computer languages as subset thereof that runs on physical computers which have finite hardware resources John C Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are languages intended execution He also argues that textual even graphical input formats that affect behavior computer are programming languages despite fact they are commonly not Turing complete remarks that ignorance programming language concepts reason many flaws in input formats History edit Main article History programming languages Early developments edit Very early computers such as Colossus were programmed without help stored program by modifying circuitry setting banks physical controls Slightly later programs could be written in machine language programmer writes each instruction in numeric form hardware can execute directly example instruction add value in two memory location might consist numbers an opcode that selects add operation two memory locations programs in decimal binary form were read in from punched cards paper tape magnetic tape toggled in on switches on front panel computer Machine languages were later termed first generation programming languages GL next step was development so called second generation programming languages GL assembly languages which were still closely tied instruction set architecture specific computer These served make program much more human readable relieved programmer tedious error prone address calculations first high level programming languages third generation programming languages GL were written in s An early high level programming language be designed computer was Plankalk l developed German Z by Konrad Zuse between However it was not implemented until John Mauchly s Short Code proposed in was one first high level languages ever developed an electronic computer Unlike machine code Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form However program had be translated into machine code every time it ran making process much slower than running equivalent machine code At University Manchester Alick Glennie developed Autocode in early s As programming language it used compiler automatically convert language into machine code first code compiler was developed in Mark computer at University Manchester considered be first compiled high level programming language second autocode was developed Mark by R Brooker in was called Mark Autocode Brooker also developed an autocode Ferranti Mercury in s in conjunction with University Manchester version EDSAC was devised by D F Hartley University Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in Known as EDSAC Autocode it was straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted local circumstances was noted its object code optimisation source language diagnostics which were advanced time contemporary but separate thread development Atlas Autocode was developed University Manchester Atlas machine In FORTRAN was invented at IBM by John Backus It was first widely used high level general purpose programming language have functional implementation as opposed just design on paper It still popular language high performance computing used programs that benchmark rank world s fastest supercomputers Another early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in US called FLOW MATIC It was developed UNIVAC at Remington Rand during period from until Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation in early she her team wrote specification an English programming language implemented prototype FLOW MATIC compiler became publicly available in early was substantially complete in FLOW MATIC was major influence in design COBOL since only it its direct descendant AIMACO were in actual use at time Refinement edit increased use high level languages introduced requirement low level programming languages system programming languages These languages varying degrees provide facilities between assembly languages high level languages They can be used perform tasks which require direct access hardware facilities but still provide higher level control structures error checking period from s late s brought development major language paradigms now in use APL introduced array programming influenced functional programming ALGOL refined both structured procedural programming discipline language specification Revised Report on Algorithmic Language ALGOL became model later language specifications were written Lisp implemented in was first dynamically typed functional programming language In s Simula was first language designed support object oriented programming in mid s Smalltalk followed with first purely object oriented language C was developed between as system programming language Unix operating system remains popular Prolog designed in was first logic programming language In ML built polymorphic type system on top Lisp pioneering statically typed functional programming languages Each these languages spawned descendants most modern programming languages count at least one them in ancestry s s also saw considerable debate over merits structured programming whether programming languages should be designed support it Edsger Dijkstra in famous letter published in Communications ACM argued that GOTO statements should be eliminated from all higher level programming languages Consolidation growth edit selection textbooks that teach programming in languages both popular obscure These are only few thousands programming languages dialects that have been designed in history s were years relative consolidation C combined object oriented systems programming United States government standardized Ada systems programming language derived from Pascal intended use by defense contractors In Japan elsewhere vast sums were spent investigating so called fifth generation languages that incorporated logic programming constructs functional languages community moved standardize ML Lisp Rather than inventing new paradigms all these movements elaborated upon ideas invented in previous decades One important trend in language design programming large scale systems during s was an increased focus on use modules large scale organizational units code Modula Ada ML all developed notable module systems in s which were often wedded generic programming constructs rapid growth Internet in mid s created opportunities new languages Perl originally Unix scripting tool first released in became common in dynamic websites Java came be used server side programming bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with promise Write once run anywhere UCSD Pascal had been popular time in early s These developments were not fundamentally novel rather they were refinements many existing languages paradigms although syntax was often based on C family programming languages Programming language evolution continues in both industry research Current directions include security reliability verification new kinds modularity mixins delegates aspects database integration such as Microsoft s LINQ Fourth generation programming languages GL are computer programming languages which aim provide higher level abstraction internal computer hardware details than GLs Fifth generation programming languages GL are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given program rather than using an algorithm written by programmer Elements edit All programming languages have some primitive building blocks description data processes transformations applied them like addition two numbers selection an item from collection These primitives are defined by syntactic semantic rules which describe structure meaning respectively Syntax edit Main article Syntax programming languages Parse tree Python code with inset tokenization Syntax highlighting often used aid programmers in recognizing elements source code language above Python programming language s surface form known as its syntax Most programming languages are purely textual they use sequences text including words numbers punctuation much like written natural languages On other hand are some programming languages which are more graphical in nature using visual relationships between symbols specify program syntax language describes possible combinations symbols that form syntactically correct program meaning given combination symbols handled by semantics either formal hard coded in reference implementation Since most languages are textual this article discusses textual syntax Programming language syntax usually defined using combination regular expressions lexical structure Backus Naur form grammatical structure Below simple grammar based on Lisp expression atom list atom number symbol number symbol Z z list expression This grammar specifies following an expression either an atom list an atom either number symbol number an unbroken sequence one more decimal digits optionally preceded by plus minus sign symbol letter followed by zero more any characters excluding whitespace list matched pair parentheses with zero more expressions inside it following are examples well formed token sequences in this grammar b c Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill formed per language s rules may depending on language specification soundness implementation result in an error on translation execution In some cases such programs may exhibit undefined behavior Even program well defined within language it may still have meaning that not intended by person wrote it Using natural language as an example it may not be possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence sentence may be false Colorless green ideas sleep furiously grammatically well formed but has no generally accepted meaning John married bachelor grammatically well formed but expresses meaning that cannot be true following C language fragment syntactically correct but performs operations that are not semantically defined operation p has no meaning value having complex type p im not defined value p null pointer complex p NULL complex abs p sqrt p p im If type declaration on first line were omitted program would trigger an error on undefined variable p during compilation However program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information grammar needed specify programming language can be classified by its position in Chomsky hierarchy syntax most programming languages can be specified using Type grammar i e they are context free grammars Some languages including Perl Lisp contain constructs that allow execution during parsing phase Languages that have constructs that allow programmer alter behavior parser make syntax analysis an undecidable problem generally blur distinction between parsing execution In contrast Lisp s macro system Perl s BEGIN blocks which may contain general computations C macros are merely string replacements do not require code execution Semantics edit term semantics refers meaning languages as opposed form syntax Static semantics edit static semantics defines restrictions on structure valid texts that are hard impossible express in standard syntactic formalisms compiled languages static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time Examples include checking that every identifier declared before it used in languages that require such declarations that labels on arms case statement are distinct Many important restrictions this type like checking that identifiers are used in appropriate context e g not adding an integer function name that subroutine calls have appropriate number type arguments can be enforced by defining them as rules in logic called type system Other forms static analyses like data flow analysis may also be part static semantics Newer programming languages like Java C have definite assignment analysis form data flow analysis as part static semantics Dynamic semantics edit Main article Semantics programming languages Once data has been specified machine must be instructed perform operations on data example semantics may define strategy by which expressions are evaluated values manner in which control structures conditionally execute statements dynamic semantics also known as execution semantics language defines various constructs language should produce program behavior are many ways defining execution semantics Natural language often used specify execution semantics languages commonly used in practice significant amount academic research went into formal semantics programming languages which allow execution semantics be specified in formal manner Results from this field research have seen limited application programming language design implementation outside academia Type system edit Main articles Data type Type system Type safety type system defines programming language classifies values expressions into types it can manipulate those types they interact goal type system verify usually enforce certain level correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations Any decidable type system involves trade off while it rejects many incorrect programs it can also prohibit some correct albeit unusual programs In order bypass this downside number languages have type loopholes usually unchecked casts that may be used by programmer explicitly allow normally disallowed operation between different types In most typed languages type system used only type check programs but number languages usually functional ones infer types relieving programmer from need write type annotations formal design study type systems known as type theory Typed versus untyped languages edit language typed if specification every operation defines types data which operation applicable example data represented by this text between quotes string in many programming languages dividing number by string has no meaning will not be executed invalid operation may be detected program compiled static type checking will be rejected by compiler with compilation error message it may be detected while program running dynamic type checking resulting in run time exception Many languages allow function called an exception handler handle this exception example always return as result special case typed languages are single typed languages These are often scripting markup languages such as REXX SGML have only one data type dubious discuss most commonly character strings which are used both symbolic numeric data In contrast an untyped language such as most assembly languages allows any operation be performed on any data generally sequences bits various lengths High level untyped languages include BCPL Tcl some varieties Forth In practice while few languages are considered typed from type theory verifying rejecting all operations most modern languages offer degree typing Many production languages provide means bypass subvert type system trading type safety finer control over program s execution see casting Static versus dynamic typing edit In static typing all expressions have types determined prior program executed typically at compile time example are integer expressions they cannot be passed function that expects string stored in variable that defined hold dates Statically typed languages can be either manifestly typed type inferred In first case programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions example at variable declarations In second case compiler infers types expressions declarations based on context Most mainstream statically typed languages such as C C Java are manifestly typed Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages such as Haskell ML However many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference example C Java C all infer types in certain limited cases Additionally some programming languages allow some types be automatically converted other types example an int can be used program expects float Dynamic typing also called latent typing determines type safety operations at run time in other words types are associated with run time values rather than textual expressions As with type inferred languages dynamically typed languages do not require programmer write explicit type annotations on expressions Among other things this may permit single variable refer values different types at different points in program execution However type errors cannot be automatically detected until piece code actually executed potentially making debugging more difficult Lisp Smalltalk Perl Python JavaScript Ruby are all examples dynamically typed languages Weak strong typing edit Weak typing allows value one type be treated as another example treating string as number This can occasionally be useful but it can also allow some kinds program faults go undetected at compile time even at run time Strong typing prevents these program faults An attempt perform an operation on wrong type value raises an error Strongly typed languages are often termed type safe safe An alternative definition weakly typed refers languages such as Perl JavaScript which permit large number implicit type conversions In JavaScript example expression x implicitly converts x number this conversion succeeds even if x null undefined an Array string letters Such implicit conversions are often useful but they can mask programming errors Strong static are now generally considered orthogonal concepts but usage in literature differs Some use term strongly typed mean strongly statically typed even more confusingly mean simply statically typed Thus C has been called both strongly typed weakly statically typed It may seem odd some professional programmers that C could be weakly statically typed However notice that use generic pointer void pointer does allow casting pointers other pointers without needing do an explicit cast This extremely similar somehow casting an array bytes any kind datatype in C without using an explicit cast such as int char Standard library run time system edit Main article Standard library Most programming languages have an associated core library sometimes known as standard library especially if it included as part published language standard which conventionally made available by all implementations language Core libraries typically include definitions commonly used algorithms data structures mechanisms input output line between language its core library differs from language language In some cases language designers may treat library as separate entity from language However language s core library often treated as part language by its users some language specifications even require that this library be made available in all implementations Indeed some languages are designed so that meanings certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring core library example in Java string literal defined as an instance java lang String class similarly in Smalltalk an anonymous function expression block constructs an instance library s BlockContext class Conversely Scheme contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice construct rest language as library macros so language designers do not even bother say which portions language must be implemented as language constructs which must be implemented as parts library Design implementation edit Programming languages share properties with natural languages related purpose as vehicles communication having syntactic form separate from its semantics showing language families related languages branching one from another But as artificial constructs they also differ in fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through usage significant difference that programming language can be fully described studied in its entirety since it has precise finite definition By contrast natural languages have changing meanings given by users in different communities While constructed languages are also artificial languages designed from ground up with specific purpose they lack precise complete semantic definition that programming language has Many programming languages have been designed from scratch altered meet new needs combined with other languages Many have eventually fallen into disuse Although have been attempts design one universal programming language that serves all purposes all them have failed be generally accepted as filling this role need diverse programming languages arises from diversity contexts in which languages are used Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists huge systems written by hundreds programmers Programmers range in expertise from novices need simplicity above all else experts may be comfortable with considerable complexity Programs must balance speed size simplicity on systems ranging from microcontrollers supercomputers Programs may be written once not change generations they may undergo continual modification Programmers may simply differ in tastes they may be accustomed discussing problems expressing them in particular language One common trend in development programming languages has been add more ability solve problems using higher level abstraction earliest programming languages were tied very closely underlying hardware computer As new programming languages have developed features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions programmers are less tied complexity computer programs can do more computing with less effort from programmer This lets them write more functionality per time unit Natural language programming has been proposed as way eliminate need specialized language programming However this goal remains distant its benefits are open debate Edsger W Dijkstra took position that use formal language essential prevent introduction meaningless constructs dismissed natural language programming as foolish Alan Perlis was similarly dismissive idea Hybrid approaches have been taken in Structured English SQL language s designers users must construct number artifacts that govern enable practice programming most important these artifacts are language specification implementation Specification edit Main article Programming language specification specification programming language an artifact that language users implementors can use agree upon whether piece source code valid program in that language if so its behavior shall be programming language specification can take several forms including following An explicit definition syntax static semantics execution semantics language While syntax commonly specified using formal grammar semantic definitions may be written in natural language e g as in C language formal semantics e g as in Standard ML Scheme specifications description behavior translator language e g C Fortran specifications syntax semantics language have be inferred from this description which may be written in natural formal language reference model implementation sometimes written in language being specified e g Prolog ANSI REXX syntax semantics language are explicit in behavior reference implementation Implementation edit Main article Programming language implementation An implementation programming language provides way write programs in that language execute them on one more configurations hardware software are broadly two approaches programming language implementation compilation interpretation It generally possible implement language using either technique output compiler may be executed by hardware program called an interpreter In some implementations that make use interpreter approach no distinct boundary between compiling interpreting instance some implementations BASIC compile then execute source line at time Programs that are executed directly on hardware usually run much faster than those that are interpreted in software better source needed One technique improving performance interpreted programs just in time compilation Here virtual machine just before execution translates blocks bytecode which are going be used machine code direct execution on hardware Proprietary languages edit This section does not cite any

programming languages with implementation available only from single vendor which may claim that such proprietary language intellectual property Proprietary programming languages are commonly domain

Some languages may make transition from closed open example Erlang was originally an Ericsson s internal programming language Use edit Thousands different programming languages have been created mainly in computing field Software commonly built with programming languages more Programming languages differ from most other forms human expression in that they require greater degree precision completeness using natural language communicate with other people human authors speakers can be ambiguous make small errors still expect intent be understood However figuratively speaking computers do exactly they are told do cannot understand code programmer intended write combination language definition program program s inputs must fully specify external behavior that occurs program executed within domain control that program On other hand ideas about an algorithm can be communicated humans without precision required execution by using pseudocode which interleaves natural language with code written in programming language programming language provides structured mechanism defining pieces data operations transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data programmer uses abstractions present in language represent concepts involved in computation These concepts are represented as collection simplest elements available called primitives Programming process by which programmers combine these primitives compose new programs adapt existing ones new uses changing environment Programs computer might be executed in batch process without human interaction user might type commands in an interactive session an interpreter In this case commands are simply programs whose execution chained together language can run its commands through an interpreter such as Unix shell other command line interface without compiling it called scripting language Measuring language usage edit Main article Measuring programming language popularity Determining which most widely used programming language difficult since definition usage varies by context One language may occupy greater number programmer hours different one has more lines code third may consume most CPU time Some languages are very popular particular kinds applications example COBOL still strong in corporate data center often on large mainframes Fortran in scientific engineering applications Ada in aerospace transportation military real time embedded applications C in embedded applications operating systems Other languages are regularly used write many different kinds applications Various methods measuring language popularity each subject different bias over measured have been proposed counting number job advertisements that mention language number books sold that teach describe language estimates number existing lines code written in language which may underestimate languages not often found in public searches counts language references i e name language found using web search engine Combining averaging information from various internet sites stackify com reported ten most popular programming languages as in descending order by overall popularity Java C C Python C JavaScript VB NET R PHP MATLAB Dialects flavors implementations edit dialect programming language data exchange language relatively small variation extension language that does not change its intrinsic nature With languages such as Scheme Forth standards may be considered insufficient inadequate illegitimate by implementors so often they will deviate from standard making new dialect In other cases dialect created use in domain specific language often subset In Lisp world most languages that use basic S expression syntax Lisp like semantics are considered Lisp dialects although they vary wildly as do say Racket Clojure As it common one language have several dialects it can become quite difficult an inexperienced programmer find right documentation BASIC programming language has many dialects explosion Forth dialects led saying If ve seen one Forth ve seen one Forth Taxonomies edit Further information Categorical list programming languages no overarching classification scheme programming languages given programming language does not usually have single ancestor language Languages commonly arise by combining elements several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at time Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout family related languages then leap suddenly across familial gaps appear in an entirely different family task further complicated by fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes example Java both an object oriented language it encourages object oriented organization concurrent language it contains built in constructs running multiple threads in parallel Python an object oriented scripting language In broad strokes programming languages divide into programming paradigms classification by intended domain use with general purpose programming languages distinguished from domain specific programming languages Traditionally programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms imperative sentences i e issuing commands These are generally called imperative programming languages great deal research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring distinction between program as set instructions program as an assertion about desired answer which main feature declarative programming More refined paradigms include procedural programming object oriented programming functional programming logic programming some languages are hybrids paradigms multi paradigmatic An assembly language not so much paradigm as direct model an underlying machine architecture By purpose programming languages might be considered general purpose system programming languages scripting languages domain specific languages concurrent distributed languages combination these Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated programming paradigm instance most programming languages use English language keywords while minority do not Other languages may be classified as being deliberately esoteric not See also edit Computer programming portal Comparison programming languages basic
