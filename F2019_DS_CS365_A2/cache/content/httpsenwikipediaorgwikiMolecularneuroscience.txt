Locating neurotransmitters edit In molecular biology communication between neurons typically occurs by chemical transmission across gaps between cells called synapses transmitted chemicals known as neurotransmitters regulate significant fraction vital body functions It possible anatomically locate neurotransmitters by labeling techniques It possible chemically identify certain neurotransmitters such as catecholamines by fixing neural tissue sections with formaldehyde This can give rise formaldehyde induced fluorescence exposed ultraviolet light Dopamine catecholamine was identified in nematode C elegans by using this technique Immunocytochemistry which involves raising antibodies against targeted chemical biological entities includes few other techniques interest targeted neurotransmitter could be specifically tagged by primary secondary antibodies with radioactive labeling in order identify neurotransmitter by autoradiography presence neurotransmitters though not necessarily location can be observed in enzyme linked immunocytochemistry enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISA in which substrate binding in enzymatic assays can induce precipitates fluorophores chemiluminescence In event that neurotransmitters cannot be histochemically identified an alternative method locate them by neural uptake mechanisms Voltage gated ion channels edit Structure eukaryotic voltage gated potassium ion channels Excitable cells in living organisms have voltage gated ion channels These can be observed throughout nervous system in neurons first ion channels be characterized were sodium potassium ion channels by L Hodgkin F Huxley in s upon studying giant axon squid genus Loligo research demonstrated selective permeability cellular membranes dependent on physiological conditions electrical effects that result from these permeabilities produce action potentials Sodium ion channels edit Sodium channels were first voltage gated ion channels be isolated in from eel Electrophorus electricus by Shosaku Numa pufferfish toxin tetrodotoxin TTX sodium channel blocker was used isolate sodium channel protein by binding it using column chromatography technique chemical separation amino acid sequence protein was analyzed by Edman degradation then used construct cDNA library which could be used clone channel protein Cloning channel itself allowed applications such as identifying same channels in other animals Sodium channels are known working in concert with potassium channels during development graded potentials action potentials Sodium channels allow an influx Na ions into neuron resulting in depolarization from resting membrane potential neuron lead graded potential action potential depending on degree depolarization Potassium ion channels edit Potassium channels come in variety forms are present in most eukaryotic cells typically tend stabilize cell membrane at potassium equilibrium potential As with sodium ions graded potentials action potentials are also dependent on potassium channels While influx Na ions into neuron induce cellular depolarization efflux influx K ions out neuron causes cell repolarize resting membrane potential activation potassium ion channels themselves are dependent on depolarization resulting from Na influx during an action potential As with sodium channels potassium channels have own toxins that block channel protein action An example such toxin large cation tetraethylammonium TEA but it notable that toxin does not have same mechanism action on all potassium channels given variety channel types across species presence potassium channels was first identified in Drosophila melanogaster mutant flies that shook uncontrollably upon anesthesia due problems in cellular repolarization that led abnormal neuron muscle electrophysiology Potassium channels were first identified by manipulating molecular genetics flies instead performing channel protein purification were no known high affinity ligands potassium channels such as TEA at time discovery Calcium ion channels edit Calcium channels are important certain cell signaling cascades as well as neurotransmitter release at axon terminals variety different types calcium ion channels are found in excitable cells As with sodium ion channels calcium ion channels have been isolated cloned by chromatographic purification techniques It notable as with case neurotransmitter release that calcium channels can interact with intracellular proteins plays strong role in signaling especially in locations such as sarcoplasmic reticulum muscle cells Receptors edit Various types receptors can be used cell signaling communication can include ionotropic receptors metabotropic receptors These cell surface receptor types are differentiated by mechanism duration action with ionotropic receptors being associated with fast signal transmission metabotropic receptors being associated with slow signal transmission Metabotropic receptors happen cover wide variety cell surface receptors with notably different signaling cascades Ionotropic receptors edit Prototypical depiction ionotropic receptor in case Ca ion flow Ionotropic receptors otherwise known as ligand gated ion channels are fast acting receptors that mediate neural physiological function by ion channel flow with ligand binding Nicotinic GABA Glutamate receptors are among some cell surface receptors regulated by ligand gated ion channel flow GABA brain s main inhibitory neurotransmitter glutamate brain s main excitatory neurotransmitter GABA receptors edit GABAA GABAC receptors are known be ionotropic while GABAB receptor metabotropic GABAA receptors mediate fast inhibitory responses in central nervous system CNS are found on neurons glial cells adrenal medulla cells It responsible inducing Cl ion influx into cells thereby reducing probability that membrane depolarization will occur upon arrival graded potential an action potential GABA receptors can also interact with non endogenous ligands influence activity example compound diazepam marketed as Valium an allosteric agonist which increases affinity receptor GABA increased physiological inhibitory effects resulting from increased GABA binding make diazepam useful tranquilizer anticonvulsant antiepileptic drugs On other hand GABA receptors can also be targeted by decreasing Cl cellular influx with effect convulsants like picrotoxin antagonistic mechanism action this compound not directly on GABA receptor but are other compounds that are capable allosteric inactivation including T butylbicyclophorothionate TBPS pentylenetetrazole PZT Compared with GABAA GABAC receptors have higher affinity GABA they are likely be longer lasting in activity responses are likely be generated by lower GABA concentrations Glutamate receptors edit Ionotropic glutamate receptors can include NMDA AMPA kainate receptors These receptors are named after agonists that facilitate glutamate activity NMDA receptors are notable excitatory mechanisms affect neuronal plasticity in learning memory as well as neuropathologies such as stroke epilepsy NDMA receptors have multiple binding sites just like ionotropic GABA receptors can be influenced by co agonists such glycine neurotransmitter phencyclidine PCP NMDA receptors carry current by Ca ions can be blocked by extracellular Mg ions depending on voltage membrane potential This Ca influx increased by excitatory postsynaptic potentials EPSPs produced by NMDA receptors activating Ca based signaling cascades such as neurotransmitter release AMPA generate shorter larger excitatory postsynaptic currents than other ionotropic glutamate receptors Nicotinic ACh receptors edit Nicotinic receptors bind acetylcholine ACh neurotransmitter produce non selective cation channel flow that generates excitatory postsynaptic responses Receptor activity which can be influenced by nicotine consumption produces feelings euphoria relaxation inevitably addiction in high levels Metabotropic receptors edit G protein linked receptor signaling cascade Metabotropic receptors are slow response receptors in postsynaptic cells Typically these slow responses are characterized by more elaborate intracellular changes in biochemistry Responses neurotransmitter uptake by metabotropic receptors can result in activation intracellualar enzymes cascades involving second messengers as case with G protein linked receptors Various metabotropic receptors can include certain glutamate receptors muscarinic ACh receptors GABAB receptors receptor tyrosine kinases G protein linked receptors edit G protein linked signaling cascade can significantly amplify signal particular neurotransmitter produce hundreds thousands second messengers in cell mechanism action by which G protein linked receptors cause signaling cascade as follows Neurotransmitter binds receptor receptor undergoes conformational change allow G protein complex binding GDP exchanged with GTP upon G protein complex binding receptor subunit G protein complex bound GTP separates bind with target protein such as adenylate cyclase binding target protein either increases decreases rate second messenger such as cyclic AMP production GTPase hydrolyzes subunit so that bound GDP subunit returns G protein complex inactive Neurotransmitter release edit Structure synapse neurotransmitter release uptake occurs Neurotransmitters are released in discrete packets known as quanta from axon terminal one neuron dendrites another across synapse These quanta have been identified by electron microscopy as synaptic vesicles Two types vesicles are small synaptic vessicles SSVs which are about nm in diameter large dense core vesicles LDCVs electron dense vesicles approximately nm in diameter former derived from endosomes houses neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine glutamate GABA glycine latter derived from Golgi apparatus houses larger neurotransmitters such as catecholamines other peptide neurotransmitters Neurotransmitters are released from an axon terminal bind postsynaptic dendrites in following procession Mobilization recruitment synaptic vesicle from cytoskeleton Docking vesicle binding presynaptic membrane Priming vesicle by ATP relatively slow step Fusion primed vesicle with presynaptic membrane exocytosis housed neurotransmitter Uptake neurotransmitters in receptors postsynaptic cell Initiation inhibition action potential in postsynaptic cell depending on whether neurotransmitters are excitatory inhibitory excitatory will result in depolarization postsynaptic membrane Neurotransmitter release calcium dependent edit Neurotransmitter release dependent on an external supply Ca ions which enter axon terminals via voltage gated calcium channels Vesicular fusion with terminal membrane release neurotransmitter caused by generation Ca gradients induced by incoming action potentials Ca ions cause mobilization newly synthesized vesicles from reserve pool undergo this membrane fusion This mechanism action was discovered in squid giant axons Lowering intracellular Ca ions provides direct inhibitory effect on neurotransmitter release After release neurotransmitter occurs vesicular membranes are recycled origins production Calcium ion channels can vary depending on location incidence example channels at an axon terminal differ from typical calcium channels cell body whether neural not Even at axon terminals calcium ion channel types can vary as case with P type calcium channels located at neuromuscular junction Neuronal gene expression edit See also Computational neurogenetic modeling Sex differences edit Differences in sex determination are controlled by sex chromosomes Sex hormonal releases have significant effect on sexual dimorphisms phenotypic differentiation sexual characteristics brain Recent studies seem suggest that regulating these dimorphisms has implications understanding normal abnormal brain function Sexual dimorphisms may be significantly influenced by sex based brain gene expression which varies from species species Animal models such as rodents Drosophila melanogaster Caenorhabditis elegans have been used observe origins extent sex bias in brain versus hormone producing gonads an animal With rodents studies on genetic manipulation sex chromosomes resulted in an effect on one sex that was completely opposite effect in other sex example knockout particular gene only resulted in anxiety like effects in males With studies on D menlanogaster it was found that large brain sex bias expression occurred even after gonads were removed suggesting that sex bias could be independent hormonal control in certain aspects Observing sex biased genes has potential clinical significance in observing brain physiology potential related whether directly indirectly neurological disorders Examples diseases with sex biases in development include Huntington s disease cerebral ischemia Alzheimer s disease Epigenetics brain edit Many brain functions can be influenced at cellular molecular level by variations changes in gene expression without altering sequence DNA in an organism This otherwise known as epigenetic regulation Examples epigenetic mechanisms include histone modifications DNA methylation Such changes have been found be strongly influential in incidence brain disease mental illness addiction Epigenetic control has been shown be involved in high levels plasticity in early development thereby defining its importance in critical period an organism Examples epigenetic changes can affect human brain are as follows Higher methylation levels in rRNA genes in hippocampus brain results in lower production proteins thus limited hippocampal function can result in learning memory impairment resultant suicidal tendencies In study comparing genetic differences between healthy people psychiatric patients different epigenetic markers associated with brain cell signaling were found Environmental factors such as child abuse appears cause expression an epigenetic tag on glucocorticoid receptors associated with stress responses that was not found in suicide victims This an example experience dependent plasticity Environmental enrichment in individuals associated with increased hippocampal gene histone acetylation thus improved memory consolidation notably spatial memory Molecular mechanisms neurodegenerative diseases edit Excitotoxicity glutamate receptors edit Excitotoxicity phenomenon in which glutamate receptors are inappropriately activated It can be caused by prolonged excitatory synaptic transmission in which high levels glutamate neurotransmitter cause excessive activation in postsynaptic neuron that can result in death postsynaptic neuron Following brain injury such as from ischemia it has been found that excitotoxicity significant cause neuronal damage This can be understandable in case sudden perfusion blood after reduced blood flow brain can result in excessive synaptic activity caused by presence increased glutamate aspartate during period ischemia Alzheimer s disease edit Alzheimer s disease most common neurodegenerative disease most common form dementia in elderly disorder characterized by progressive loss memory various cognitive functions It hypothesized that deposition amyloid peptide amino acid residues in brain integral in incidence Alzheimer s disease Accumulation purported block hippocampal long term potentiation It also possible that receptor amyloid oligomers could be prion protein Parkinson s disease edit Parkinson s disease second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer s disease It hypokinetic movement basal ganglia disease caused by loss dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra human brain inhibitory outflow basal ganglia thus not decreased so upper motor neurons mediated by thalamus are not activated in timely manner Specific symptoms include rigidity postural problems slow movements tremors Blocking GABA receptor input from medium spiny neurons reticulata cells causes inhibition upper motor neurons similar inhibition that occurs in Parkinson s disease Huntington s disease edit Huntington s disease hyperkinetic movement basal ganglia disease caused by lack normal inhibitory inputs from medium spiny neurons basal ganglia This poses opposite effects those associated with Parkinson s disease including inappropriate activation upper motor neurons As with GABAergic mechanisms observed in relation Parkinson s disease GABA agonist injected into substantia nigra pars reticulata decreases inhibition upper motor neurons resulting in ballistic involuntary motor movements similar symptoms
