genes genetic variation heredity in organisms Though heredity had been observed millennia Gregor Mendel scientist Augustinian friar working in th century was first study genetics scientifically Mendel studied trait inheritance patterns in way traits are handed down from parents offspring He observed that organisms pea plants inherit traits by way discrete units inheritance This term still used today somewhat ambiguous definition referred as gene Trait inheritance molecular inheritance mechanisms genes are still primary principles genetics in st century but modern genetics has expanded

meaning origin History edit Main article History genetics observation that living things inherit traits from parents has been used since prehistoric times improve crop plants animals through selective breeding modern science genetics seeking understand this process began with work Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel in mid th century Prior Mendel Imre Festetics Hungarian noble lived in K szeg before Mendel was first used word genetics He described several rules genetic inheritance in his work genetic law Nature Die genetische Ges tze der Natur His second law same as Mendel published In his third law he developed basic principles mutation he can be considered forerunner Hugo de Vries Blending inheritance leads averaging out every characteristic which as engineer Fleeming Jenkin pointed out makes evolution by natural selection impossible Other theories inheritance preceded Mendel s work popular theory during th century implied by Charles Darwin s On Origin Species was blending inheritance idea that individuals inherit smooth blend traits from parents Mendel s work provided examples traits were definitely not blended after hybridization showing that traits are produced by combinations distinct genes rather than continuous blend Blending traits in progeny now explained by action multiple genes with quantitative effects Another theory that had some support at that time was inheritance acquired characteristics belief that individuals inherit traits strengthened by parents This theory commonly associated with Jean Baptiste Lamarck now known be wrong experiences individuals do not affect genes they pass children although evidence in field epigenetics has revived some aspects Lamarck s theory Other theories included pangenesis Charles Darwin which had both acquired inherited aspects Francis Galton s reformulation pangenesis as both particulate inherited Mendelian classical genetics edit Morgan s observation sex linked inheritance mutation causing white eyes in Drosophila led him hypothesis that genes are located upon chromosomes Further information Mutationism Modern synthesis th century Modern genetics started with Mendel s studies nature inheritance in plants In his paper Versuche ber Pflanzenhybriden Experiments on Plant Hybridization presented in Naturforschender Verein Society Research in Nature in Br nn Mendel traced inheritance patterns certain traits in pea plants described them mathematically Although this pattern inheritance could only be observed few traits Mendel s work suggested that heredity was particulate not acquired that inheritance patterns many traits could be explained through simple rules ratios importance Mendel s work did not gain wide understanding until after his death Hugo de Vries other scientists rediscovered his research William Bateson proponent Mendel s work coined word genetics in adjective genetic derived from Greek word genesis origin predates noun was first used in biological sense in Bateson both acted as mentor was aided significantly by work other scientists from Newnham College at Cambridge specifically work Becky Saunders Nora Darwin Barlow Muriel Wheldale Onslow Bateson popularized usage word genetics describe study inheritance in his inaugural address Third International Conference on Plant Hybridization in London in After rediscovery Mendel s work scientists tried determine which molecules in cell were responsible inheritance In Thomas Hunt Morgan argued that genes are on chromosomes based on observations sex linked white eye mutation in fruit flies In his student Alfred Sturtevant used phenomenon genetic linkage show that genes are arranged linearly on chromosome Molecular genetics edit DNA molecular basis biological inheritance Each strand DNA chain nucleotides matching each other in center form look like rungs on twisted ladder Although genes were known exist on chromosomes chromosomes are composed both protein DNA scientists did not know which two responsible inheritance In Frederick Griffith discovered phenomenon transformation see Griffith s experiment dead bacteria could transfer genetic material transform other still living bacteria Sixteen years later in Avery MacLeod McCarty experiment identified DNA as molecule responsible transformation role nucleus as repository genetic information in eukaryotes had been established by H mmerling in in his work on single celled alga Acetabularia Hershey Chase experiment in confirmed that DNA rather than protein genetic material viruses that infect bacteria providing further evidence that DNA molecule responsible inheritance James Watson Francis Crick determined structure DNA in using X ray crystallography work Rosalind Franklin Maurice Wilkins that indicated DNA has helical structure i e shaped like corkscrew double helix model had two strands DNA with nucleotides pointing inward each matching complementary nucleotide on other strand form look like rungs on twisted ladder This structure showed that genetic information exists in sequence nucleotides on each strand DNA structure also suggested simple method replication if strands are separated new partner strands can be reconstructed each based on sequence old strand This property gives DNA its semi conservative nature one strand new DNA from an original parent strand Although structure DNA showed inheritance works it was still not known DNA influences behavior cells In following years scientists tried understand DNA controls process protein production It was discovered that cell uses DNA as template create matching messenger RNA molecules with nucleotides very similar DNA nucleotide sequence messenger RNA used create an amino acid sequence in protein this translation between nucleotide sequences amino acid sequences known as genetic code With newfound molecular understanding inheritance came an explosion research notable theory arose from Tomoko Ohta in with her amendment neutral theory molecular evolution through publishing nearly neutral theory molecular evolution In this theory Ohta stressed importance natural selection environment rate at which genetic evolution occurs One important development was chain termination DNA sequencing in by Frederick Sanger This technology allows scientists read nucleotide sequence DNA molecule In Kary Banks Mullis developed polymerase chain reaction providing quick way isolate amplify specific section DNA from mixture efforts Human Genome Project Department Energy NIH parallel private efforts by Celera Genomics led sequencing human genome in Features inheritance edit Discrete inheritance Mendel s laws edit Main article Mendelian inheritance Punnett square depicting cross between two pea plants heterozygous purple B white b blossoms At its most fundamental level inheritance in organisms occurs by passing discrete heritable units called genes from parents offspring This property was first observed by Gregor Mendel studied segregation heritable traits in pea plants In his experiments studying trait flower color Mendel observed that flowers each pea plant were either purple white but never an intermediate between two colors These different discrete versions same gene are called alleles In case pea which diploid species each individual plant has two copies each gene one copy inherited from each parent Many species including humans have this pattern inheritance Diploid organisms with two copies same allele given gene are called homozygous at that gene locus while organisms with two different alleles given gene are called heterozygous set alleles given organism called its genotype while observable traits organism are called its phenotype organisms are heterozygous at gene often one allele called dominant as its qualities dominate phenotype organism while other allele called recessive as its qualities recede are not observed Some alleles do not have complete dominance instead have incomplete dominance by expressing an intermediate phenotype codominance by expressing both alleles at once pair organisms reproduce sexually offspring randomly inherit one two alleles from each parent These observations discrete inheritance segregation alleles are collectively known as Mendel s first law Law Segregation Notation diagrams edit Genetic pedigree charts help track inheritance patterns traits Geneticists use diagrams symbols describe inheritance gene represented by one few letters Often symbol used mark usual non mutant allele gene In fertilization breeding experiments especially discussing Mendel s laws parents are referred as P generation offspring as F first filial generation F offspring mate with each other offspring are called F second filial generation One common diagrams used predict result cross breeding Punnett square studying human genetic diseases geneticists often use pedigree charts represent inheritance traits These charts map inheritance trait in family tree Multiple gene interactions edit Human height trait with complex genetic causes Francis Galton s data from shows relationship between offspring height as function mean parent height Organisms have thousands genes in sexually reproducing organisms these genes generally assort independently each other This means that inheritance an allele yellow green pea color unrelated inheritance alleles white purple flowers This phenomenon known as Mendel s second law law independent assortment means that alleles different genes get shuffled between parents form offspring with many different combinations Some genes do not assort independently demonstrating genetic linkage topic discussed later in this article Often different genes can interact in way that influences same trait In Blue eyed Mary Omphalodes verna example exists gene with alleles that determine color flowers blue magenta Another gene however controls whether flowers have color at all are white plant has two copies this white allele its flowers are white regardless whether first gene has blue magenta alleles This interaction between genes called epistasis with second gene epistatic first Many traits are not discrete features e g purple white flowers but are instead continuous features e g human height skin color These complex traits are products many genes influence these genes mediated varying degrees by environment an organism has experienced degree which an organism s genes contribute complex trait called heritability Measurement heritability trait relative in more variable environment environment has bigger influence on total variation trait example human height trait with complex causes It has heritability in United States In Nigeria however people experience more variable access good nutrition health care height has heritability only Molecular basis inheritance edit DNA chromosomes edit Main articles DNA Chromosome molecular structure DNA Bases pair through arrangement hydrogen bonding between strands molecular basis genes deoxyribonucleic acid DNA DNA composed chain nucleotides which are four types adenine cytosine C guanine G thymine T Genetic information exists in sequence these nucleotides genes exist as stretches sequence along DNA chain Viruses are only exception this rule sometimes viruses use very similar molecule RNA instead DNA as genetic material Viruses cannot reproduce without host are unaffected by many genetic processes so tend not be considered living organisms DNA normally exists as double stranded molecule coiled into shape double helix Each nucleotide in DNA preferentially pairs with its partner nucleotide on opposite strand pairs with T C pairs with G Thus in its two stranded form each strand effectively contains all necessary information redundant with its partner strand This structure DNA physical basis inheritance DNA replication duplicates genetic information by splitting strands using each strand as template synthesis new partner strand Genes are arranged linearly along long chains DNA base pair sequences In bacteria each cell usually contains single circular genophore while eukaryotic organisms such as plants animals have DNA arranged in multiple linear chromosomes These DNA strands are often extremely long largest human chromosome example about million base pairs in length DNA chromosome associated with structural proteins that organize compact control access DNA forming material called chromatin in eukaryotes chromatin usually composed nucleosomes segments DNA wound around cores histone proteins full set hereditary material in an organism usually combined DNA sequences all chromosomes called genome While haploid organisms have only one copy each chromosome most animals many plants are diploid containing two each chromosome thus two copies every gene two alleles gene are located on identical loci two homologous chromosomes each allele inherited from different parent Walther Flemming s diagram eukaryotic cell division Chromosomes are copied condensed organized Then as cell divides chromosome copies separate into daughter cells Many species have so called sex chromosomes that determine gender each organism In humans many other animals Y chromosome contains gene that triggers development specifically male characteristics In evolution this chromosome has lost most its content also most its genes while X chromosome similar other chromosomes contains many genes X Y chromosomes form strongly heterogeneous pair Reproduction edit Main articles Asexual reproduction Sexual reproduction cells divide full genome copied each daughter cell inherits one copy This process called mitosis simplest form reproduction basis asexual reproduction Asexual reproduction can also occur in multicellular organisms producing offspring that inherit genome from single parent Offspring that are genetically identical parents are called clones Eukaryotic organisms often use sexual reproduction generate offspring that contain mixture genetic material inherited from two different parents process sexual reproduction alternates between forms that contain single copies genome haploid double copies diploid Haploid cells fuse combine genetic material create diploid cell with paired chromosomes Diploid organisms form haploids by dividing without replicating DNA create daughter cells that randomly inherit one each pair chromosomes Most animals many plants are diploid most lifespan with haploid form reduced single cell gametes such as sperm eggs Although they do not use haploid diploid method sexual reproduction bacteria have many methods acquiring new genetic information Some bacteria can undergo conjugation transferring small circular piece DNA another bacterium Bacteria can also take up raw DNA fragments found in environment integrate them into genomes phenomenon known as transformation These processes result in horizontal gene transfer transmitting fragments genetic information between organisms that would be otherwise unrelated Recombination genetic linkage edit Main articles Chromosomal crossover Genetic linkage Thomas Hunt Morgan s illustration double crossover between chromosomes diploid nature chromosomes allows genes on different chromosomes assort independently be separated from homologous pair during sexual reproduction wherein haploid gametes are formed In this way new combinations genes can occur in offspring mating pair Genes on same chromosome would theoretically never recombine However they do via cellular process chromosomal crossover During crossover chromosomes exchange stretches DNA effectively shuffling gene alleles between chromosomes This process chromosomal crossover generally occurs during meiosis series cell divisions that creates haploid cells first cytological demonstration crossing over was performed by Harriet Creighton Barbara McClintock in research experiments on corn provided cytological evidence genetic theory that linked genes on paired chromosomes do in fact exchange places from one homolog other probability chromosomal crossover occurring between two given points on chromosome related distance between points an arbitrarily long distance probability crossover high enough that inheritance genes effectively uncorrelated genes that are closer together however lower probability crossover means that genes demonstrate genetic linkage alleles two genes tend be inherited together amounts linkage between series genes can be combined form linear linkage map that roughly describes arrangement genes along chromosome Gene expression edit Genetic code edit Main article Genetic code genetic code Using triplet code DNA through messenger RNA intermediary specifies protein Genes generally express functional effect through production proteins which are complex molecules responsible most functions in cell Proteins are made up one more polypeptide chains each which composed sequence amino acids DNA sequence gene through an RNA intermediate used produce specific amino acid sequence This process begins with production an RNA molecule with sequence matching gene s DNA sequence process called transcription This messenger RNA molecule then used produce corresponding amino acid sequence through process called translation Each group three nucleotides in sequence called codon corresponds either one twenty possible amino acids in protein an instruction end amino acid sequence this correspondence called genetic code flow information unidirectional information transferred from nucleotide sequences into amino acid sequence proteins but it never transfers from protein back into sequence DNA phenomenon Francis Crick called central dogma molecular biology specific sequence amino acids results in unique three dimensional structure that protein three dimensional structures proteins are related functions Some are simple structural molecules like fibers formed by protein collagen Proteins can bind other proteins simple molecules sometimes acting as enzymes by facilitating chemical reactions within bound molecules without changing structure protein itself Protein structure dynamic protein hemoglobin bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates capture transport release oxygen molecules within mammalian blood single nucleotide difference within DNA can cause change in amino acid sequence protein protein structures are result amino acid sequences some changes can dramatically change properties protein by destabilizing structure changing surface protein in way that changes its interaction with other proteins molecules example sickle cell anemia human genetic disease that results from single base difference within coding region globin section hemoglobin causing single amino acid change that changes hemoglobin s physical properties Sickle cell versions hemoglobin stick themselves stacking form fibers that distort shape red blood cells carrying protein These sickle shaped cells no longer flow smoothly through blood vessels having tendency clog degrade causing medical problems associated with this disease Some DNA sequences are transcribed into RNA but are not translated into protein products such RNA molecules are called non coding RNA In some cases these products fold into structures which are involved in critical cell functions e g ribosomal RNA transfer RNA RNA can also have regulatory effects through hybridization interactions with other RNA molecules e g microRNA Nature nurture edit Main article Nature nurture Siamese cats have temperature sensitive pigment production mutation Although genes contain all information an organism uses function environment plays an important role in determining ultimate phenotypes an organism displays phrase nature nurture refers this complementary relationship phenotype an organism depends on interaction genes environment An interesting example coat coloration Siamese cat In this case body temperature cat plays role environment cat s genes code dark hair thus hair producing cells in cat make cellular proteins resulting in dark hair But these dark hair producing proteins are sensitive temperature i e have mutation causing temperature sensitivity denature in higher temperature environments failing produce dark hair pigment in areas cat has higher body temperature In low temperature environment however protein s structure stable produces dark hair pigment normally protein remains functional in areas skin that are colder such as its legs ears tail face so cat has dark hair at its extremities Environment plays major role in effects human genetic disease phenylketonuria mutation that causes phenylketonuria disrupts ability body break down amino acid phenylalanine causing toxic build up an intermediate molecule that in turn causes severe symptoms progressive intellectual disability seizures However if someone with phenylketonuria mutation follows strict diet that avoids this amino acid they remain normal healthy common method determining genes environment nature nurture contribute phenotype involves studying identical fraternal twins other siblings multiple births Identical siblings are genetically same since they come from same zygote Meanwhile fraternal twins are as genetically different from one another as normal siblings By comparing often certain disorder occurs in pair identical twins often it occurs in pair fraternal twins scientists can determine whether that disorder caused by genetic postnatal environmental factors One famous example involved study Genain quadruplets were identical quadruplets all diagnosed with schizophrenia However such tests cannot separate genetic factors from environmental factors affecting fetal development Gene regulation edit Main article Regulation gene expression genome given organism contains thousands genes but not all these genes need be active at any given moment gene expressed it being transcribed into mRNA exist many cellular methods controlling expression genes such that proteins are produced only needed by cell Transcription factors are regulatory proteins that bind DNA either promoting inhibiting transcription gene Within genome Escherichia coli bacteria example exists series genes necessary synthesis amino acid tryptophan However tryptophan already available cell these genes tryptophan synthesis are no longer needed presence tryptophan directly affects activity genes tryptophan molecules bind tryptophan repressor transcription factor changing repressor s structure such that repressor binds genes tryptophan repressor blocks transcription expression genes thereby creating negative feedback regulation tryptophan synthesis process Transcription factors bind DNA influencing transcription associated genes Differences in gene expression are especially clear within multicellular organisms cells all contain same genome but have very different structures behaviors due expression different sets genes All cells in multicellular organism derive from single cell differentiating into variant cell types in response external intercellular signals gradually establishing different patterns gene expression create different behaviors As no single gene responsible development structures within multicellular organisms these patterns arise from complex interactions between many cells Within eukaryotes exist structural features chromatin that influence transcription genes often in form modifications DNA chromatin that are stably inherited by daughter cells These features are called epigenetic they exist on top DNA sequence retain inheritance from one cell generation next epigenetic features different cell types grown within same medium can retain very different properties Although epigenetic features are generally dynamic over course development some like phenomenon paramutation have multigenerational inheritance exist as rare exceptions general rule DNA as basis inheritance Genetic change edit Mutations edit Main article Mutation Gene duplication allows diversification by providing redundancy one gene can mutate lose its original function without harming organism During process DNA replication errors occasionally occur in polymerization second strand These errors called mutations can affect phenotype an organism especially if they occur within protein coding sequence gene Error rates are usually very low error in every million bases due proofreading ability DNA polymerases Processes that increase rate changes in DNA are called mutagenic mutagenic chemicals promote errors in DNA replication often by interfering with structure base pairing while UV radiation induces mutations by causing damage DNA structure Chemical damage DNA occurs naturally as well cells use DNA repair mechanisms repair mismatches breaks repair does not however always restore original sequence In organisms that use chromosomal crossover exchange DNA recombine genes errors in alignment during meiosis can also cause mutations Errors in crossover are especially likely similar sequences cause partner chromosomes adopt mistaken alignment this makes some regions in genomes more prone mutating in this way These errors create large structural changes in DNA sequence duplications inversions deletions entire regions accidental exchange whole parts sequences between different chromosomes chromosomal translocation This diagram showing mutations in an RNA sequence Figure normal RNA sequence consisting codons Figure shows missense single point non silent mutation Figures both show frameshift mutations which they are grouped together Figure shows deletion second base pair in second codon Figure shows an insertion in third base pair second codon Figure shows repeat expansion an entire codon duplicated Natural selection evolution edit Main article Evolution Further information Natural selection Mutations alter an organism s genotype occasionally this causes different phenotypes appear Most mutations have little effect on an organism s phenotype health reproductive fitness Mutations that do have an effect are usually detrimental but occasionally some can be beneficial Studies in fly Drosophila melanogaster suggest that if mutation changes protein produced by gene about percent these mutations will be harmful with remainder being either neutral weakly beneficial An evolutionary tree eukaryotic organisms constructed by comparison several orthologous gene sequences Population genetics studies distribution genetic differences within populations these distributions change over time Changes in frequency an allele in population are mainly influenced by natural selection given allele provides selective reproductive advantage organism as well as other factors such as mutation genetic drift genetic hitchhiking artificial selection migration Over many generations genomes organisms can change significantly resulting in evolution In process called adaptation selection beneficial mutations can cause species evolve into forms better able survive in environment New species are formed through process speciation often caused by geographical separations that prevent populations from exchanging genes with each other By comparing homology between different species genomes it possible calculate evolutionary distance between them they may have diverged Genetic comparisons are generally considered more accurate method characterizing relatedness between species than comparison phenotypic characteristics evolutionary distances between species can be used form evolutionary trees these trees represent common descent divergence species over time although they do not show transfer genetic material between unrelated species known as horizontal gene transfer most common in bacteria Model organisms edit common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster popular model organism in genetics research Although geneticists originally studied inheritance in wide range organisms researchers began specialize in studying genetics particular subset organisms fact that significant research already existed given organism would encourage new researchers choose it further study so eventually few model organisms became basis most genetics research Common research topics in model organism genetics include study gene regulation involvement genes in development cancer Organisms were chosen in part convenience short generation times easy genetic manipulation made some organisms popular genetics research tools Widely used model organisms include gut bacterium Escherichia coli plant Arabidopsis thaliana baker s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae nematode Caenorhabditis elegans common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster common house mouse Mus musculus Medicine edit Schematic relationship between biochemistry genetics molecular biology Medical genetics seeks understand genetic variation relates human health disease searching an unknown gene that may be involved in disease researchers commonly use genetic linkage genetic pedigree charts find location on genome associated with disease At population level researchers take advantage Mendelian randomization look locations in genome that are associated with diseases method especially useful multigenic traits not clearly defined by single gene Once candidate gene found further research often done on corresponding homologous genes model organisms In addition studying genetic diseases increased availability genotyping methods has led field pharmacogenetics study genotype can affect drug responses Individuals differ in inherited tendency develop cancer cancer genetic disease process cancer development in body combination events Mutations occasionally occur within cells in body as they divide Although these mutations will not be inherited by any offspring they can affect behavior cells sometimes causing them grow divide more frequently are biological mechanisms that attempt stop this process signals are given inappropriately dividing cells that should trigger cell death but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause cells ignore these messages An internal process natural selection occurs within body eventually mutations accumulate within cells promote own growth creating cancerous tumor that grows invades various tissues body Normally cell divides only in response signals called growth factors stops growing once in contact with surrounding cells in response growth inhibitory signals It usually then divides limited number times dies staying within epithelium it unable migrate other organs become cancer cell cell has accumulate mutations in number genes three seven cancer cell can divide without growth factor ignores inhibitory signals Also it immortal can grow indefinitely even after it makes contact with neighboring cells It may escape from epithelium ultimately from primary tumor Then escaped cell can cross endothelium blood vessel get transported by bloodstream colonize new organ forming deadly metastasis Although are some genetic predispositions in small fraction cancers major fraction due set new genetic mutations that originally appear accumulate in one small number cells that will divide form tumor are not transmitted progeny somatic mutations most frequent mutations are loss function p protein tumor suppressor in p pathway gain function mutations in Ras proteins in other oncogenes Research methods edit Colonies E coli produced by cellular cloning similar methodology often used in molecular cloning DNA can be manipulated in laboratory Restriction enzymes are commonly used enzymes that cut DNA at specific sequences producing predictable fragments DNA DNA fragments can be visualized through use gel electrophoresis which separates fragments according length use ligation enzymes allows DNA fragments be connected By binding ligating fragments DNA together from different sources researchers can create recombinant DNA DNA often associated with genetically modified organisms Recombinant DNA commonly used in context plasmids short circular DNA molecules with few genes on them In process known as molecular cloning researchers can amplify DNA fragments by inserting plasmids into bacteria then culturing them on plates agar isolate clones bacteria cells cloning can also refer various means creating cloned clonal organisms DNA can also be amplified using procedure called polymerase chain reaction PCR By using specific short sequences DNA PCR can isolate exponentially amplify targeted region DNA it can amplify from extremely small amounts DNA PCR also often used detect presence specific DNA sequences DNA sequencing genomics edit DNA sequencing one most fundamental technologies developed study genetics allows researchers determine sequence nucleotides in DNA fragments technique chain termination sequencing developed in by team led by Frederick Sanger still routinely used sequence DNA fragments Using this technology researchers have been able study molecular sequences associated with many human diseases As sequencing has become less expensive researchers have sequenced genomes many organisms using process called genome assembly which utilizes computational tools stitch together sequences from many different fragments These technologies were used sequence human genome in Human Genome Project completed in New high throughput sequencing technologies are dramatically lowering cost DNA sequencing with many researchers hoping bring cost resequencing human genome down thousand dollars Next generation sequencing high throughput sequencing came about due ever increasing demand low cost sequencing These sequencing technologies allow production potentially millions sequences concurrently large amount sequence data available has created field genomics research that uses computational tools search analyze patterns in full genomes organisms Genomics can also be considered subfield bioinformatics which uses computational approaches analyze large sets biological data common problem these fields research manage share data that
