looking develop strength shots improve stick handling skills Players looking increase wrist strength often practice with steel pucks that weigh pounds g these pucks are not used shooting as they could seriously harm other players White pucks are used goaltender practice These are regulation size weight but made from white rubber hollow light weight fluorescent orange puck available road floor hockey Other variants some with plastic ball bearings glides are available use road roller hockey citation needed Two major developments have been devised create better puck visibility on television broadcasts but both were short lived Firepuck edit use Firepuck in early s was first attempt improve visibility hockey pucks as seen on television This invention incorporated coloured retro reflective materials either embedded lens elements prismatic reflectors laminated into recesses on flat surfaces vertical edge standard hockey puck Yellow was preferred reflected colour spotlight was required be positioned on TV camera focused at centre viewing area short demonstration tape Minnesota North Stars skating with Firepuck was shown during period break at NHL All Star Game in Montreal International Hockey League IHL pursued testing Firepuck with its inventor Donald Klassen next television viewing was IHL All Star Game in Fort Wayne Indiana January Firepuck was used entire game IHL tested Firepuck in two more games finally East Coast Hockey League used it January all star game use Firepuck was discontinued these reasons slight structural change increased tendency puck bounce on ice This made it more difficult goaltender resulted in increased scoring skaters objected use camera spotlights which reflected off ice television viewing contrast Firepuck was not noticeably enhanced camera view was entire rink this being most common camera shot Firepuck name was branded during s but has since been discontinued Smart puck edit See also FoxTrax FoxTrax smart puck was developed by Fox television network it held National Hockey League NHL broadcasting rights United States puck had integrated electronics track its position on screen blue streak traced path puck across ice streak would turn red if puck was shot especially hard This was an experiment in broadcasting intended help viewers unfamiliar with hockey better follow game by making puck more visible It was ill received

glass plexiglass panels that sit atop boards hockey rinks protect spectators have been supplemented with mesh nets that extend above upper edge glass Manufacture edit NHL regulation pucks were not required professional play until season but were standardized consistent play ease manufacture half century earlier by Art Ross in Major manufacturers pucks exist in Canada Russia Czech Republic People s Republic China better source needed Slovakia list former present day major producers includes Viceroy Sher Wood Pro Flex Gufex Rubena Vegum Doln Vestenice Converse HockeyShot Spalding Xiamen Yin Hua Silicone Rubber Products Co Ltd Xiamen Deng Hong Silica Gel Product Co Ltd Xiamen Ijetech Industry Trade Co Ltd black rubber puck made up mix natural rubber antioxidants bonding materials other chemicals achieve balance hardness resilience This mixture then turned in machine with metal rollers workers add extra natural rubber ensure that mixing even Samples are then put into machine that analyses if rubber will harden at right temperature An automated apparatus called pultrusion machine extrudes rubber into long circular logs that are inches cm in diameter then cut into inch cm thick pieces while still soft These pre forms are then manually put into moulds that are exact size finished puck are up mould cavities per moulding palette capable producing up pucks per week moulds are then compressed This compression may be done cold with moulds heated F C minutes depending on proprietary methods manufacturer They come out hard then are allowed sit hours Each puck manually cleaned with trimmer machine remove excess rubber moulding process adds diamond cross hatch texture around edge puck more friction between stick puck better control puck handling practice pucks are made by similar but faster process that uses larger pre forms in cm thick puts them into moulds automatically applies more pressure heat over shorter period time compress puck into standard size This allows approximately twice as many pucks be manufactured in same time period as more exacting production NHL regulation pucks People sometimes freeze pucks prevent them from sticking ice In roller hockey edit Roller hockey pucks are similar ice hockey pucks but made from plastic thus lighter They have small ribs protruding from tops bottoms which limit contact with surface allowing better sliding motion less friction Most commonly red roller hockey pucks can be found in almost any colour although light visible colours such as red orange yellow pink green are typical Roller hockey pucks were created so inline hockey street hockey players could play with puck instead ball on surfaces such as hardwood concrete asphalt In underwater hockey edit Underwater Hockey puck pushed by stick An

standard puck exists junior competition approximately lb oz kg similar construction standard puck While are numerous regional variations in colour construction materials all must conform international regulations stipulating overall dimensions weight regulations state that pucks should be bright distinctive colour example high visibility pink orange that World Championships these are only acceptable colours In other sports games edit term puck sometimes also applied similar though often smaller gaming discs in other sports games including novuss shuffleboard table shuffleboard box hockey air hockey Alternative uses edit Ice hockey pucks regulation inch cm diameter inch cm thickness may be used as mechanical vibration dampening isolators in places such as feet light industrial air compressors air conditioning units they are regulation materials therefore consistent manufacture size shape are constructed repeatable consistent vulcanized rubber material Since material rubber
