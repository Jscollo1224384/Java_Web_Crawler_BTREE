processes investigation individual psychological differences investigation human nature psychological similarities between individuals Personality an organized set characteristics possessed by person that uniquely clarification needed influences environment cognition emotions motivations behaviors in various situations word personality originates from Latin persona which means mask Personality also refers pattern thoughts feelings social adjustments behaviors consistently exhibited over time that strongly influences one s expectations self perceptions values attitudes Personality also predicts human reactions other people problems stress Gordon Allport described two major ways study personality nomothetic idiographic Nomothetic psychology seeks general laws that can be applied many different people such as principle self actualization trait extraversion Idiographic psychology an attempt understand unique aspects particular individual study personality has broad varied history in psychology with an abundance theoretical traditions major theories include dispositional trait perspective psychodynamic humanistic biological behaviorist evolutionary social learning perspective However many researchers psychologists do not explicitly identify themselves with certain perspective instead take an eclectic approach Research in this area empirically driven such as dimensional models based on multivariate statistics such as factor analysis emphasizes theory development such as that psychodynamic theory also substantial emphasis on applied field personality testing In psychological education training study nature personality its psychological development usually reviewed as prerequisite courses in abnormal psychology clinical psychology Contents Philosophical

Evolutionary theory Drive theories Personality tests Personality theory assessment criteria Methods measuring inner experience See also References Further reading External links Philosophical assumptions edit Many ideas developed by historical modern personality theorists stem from basic philosophical assumptions they hold study personality not purely empirical discipline as it brings in elements art science philosophy draw general conclusions following five categories are some most fundamental philosophical assumptions on which theorists disagree Freedom versus determinism This question whether humans have control over own behavior understand motives behind it if behavior causally determined by forces beyond control Behavior categorized as being either unconscious environmental biological by various theories Heredity Nature versus environment Nurture Personality thought be determined largely either by genetics biology by environment experiences Contemporary research suggests that most personality traits are based on joint influence genetics environment One forerunners in this arena C Robert Cloninger pioneered Temperament Character model Uniqueness versus universality This question discusses extent each human s individuality uniqueness similarity in nature universality Gordon Allport Abraham Maslow Carl Rogers were all advocates uniqueness individuals Behaviorists cognitive theorists in contrast emphasize importance universal principles such as reinforcement self efficacy Active versus reactive This question explores whether humans primarily act through individual initiative active through outside stimuli Traditional behavioral theorists typically believed that humans are passively shaped by environments whereas humanistic cognitive theorists believe that humans are more active in role Most modern theorists agree that both are important with aggregate behavior being primarily determined by traits situational factors being primary predictor behavior in short term Optimistic versus pessimistic Personality theories differ with regard whether humans are integral in changing own personalities Theories that place great deal emphasis on learning are often more optimistic than those that do not Personality theories edit Type theories edit Personality type refers psychological classification different types people Personality types are distinguished from personality traits which come in different degrees are many types theories regarding personality but each theory contains several sometimes many sub theories theory personality constructed by any given psychologist will contain multiple relating theories sub theories often expanding as more psychologists explore theory example according type theories are two types people introverts extroverts According trait theories introversion extroversion are part continuous dimension with many people in middle idea psychological types originated in theoretical work Carl Jung specifically in his book Psychologische Typen Psychological Types William Marston Building on writings observations Jung during World War II Isabel Briggs Myers her mother Katharine C Briggs delineated personality types by constructing Myers Briggs Type Indicator This model was later used by David Keirsey with different understanding from Jung Briggs Myers In former Soviet Union Lithuanian Au ra Augustinavi i t independently derived model personality type from Jung s called socionics Theories could also be considered an approach personality psychology generally referred as model model an older more theoretical approach personality accepting extroversion introversion as basic psychological orientations in connection with two pairs psychological functions Perceiving functions sensing intuition trust in concrete sensory oriented facts vs trust in abstract concepts imagined possibilities Judging functions thinking feeling basing decisions primarily on logic vs deciding based on emotion Briggs Myers also added another personality dimension type indicator measure whether person prefers use judging perceiving function interacting with external world Therefore they included questions designed indicate whether someone wishes come conclusions judgement keep options open perception This personality typology has some aspects trait theory it explains people s behavior in terms opposite fixed characteristics In these more traditional models sensing intuition preference considered most basic dividing people into N intuitive S sensing personality types An N further assumed be guided either by thinking feeling divided into NT scientist engineer NF author humanitarian temperament An S in contrast assumed be guided more by judgment perception axis thus divided into SJ guardian traditionalist SP performer artisan temperament These four are considered basic with other two factors in each case including always extraversion introversion less important Critics this traditional view have observed that types can be quite strongly stereotyped by professions although neither Myers nor Keirsey engaged in such stereotyping in type descriptions thus may arise more from need categorize people purposes guiding career choice This among other objections led emergence five factor view which less concerned with behavior under work conditions more concerned with behavior in personal emotional circumstances MBTI not designed measure work self but rather Myers McCaulley called shoes off self Type Type B personality theory During s Meyer Friedman his co workers defined they called Type Type B behavior patterns They theorized that intense hard driving Type personalities had higher risk coronary disease they are stress junkies Type B people on other hand tended be relaxed less competitive lower in risk was also Type AB mixed profile John L Holland s RIASEC vocational model commonly referred as Holland Codes stipulates that six personality types lead people choose career paths In this circumplex model six types are represented as hexagon with adjacent types more closely related than those more distant model widely used in vocational counseling Trnka et al pointed out reductionist nature two dimensional paradigm in psychological theory emotions challenge circumplex model constructed D hypercube projection Eduard Spranger s personality model consisting six by some revisions basic types value attitudes described in his book Types Men Lebensformen Halle Saale Niemeyer English translation by P J W Pigors New York G E Stechert Company Enneagram Personality model human personality which principally used as typology nine interconnected personality types It has been criticized as being subject interpretation making it difficult test validate scientifically Perhaps most ancient attempt at personality psychology personality typology outlined by Indian Buddhist Abhidharma schools This typology mostly focuses on negative personal traits greed hatred delusion corresponding positive meditation practices used counter those traits Psychoanalytical theories edit Psychoanalytic theories explain human behavior in terms interaction various components personality Sigmund Freud was founder this school thought Freud drew on physics his day thermodynamics coin term psychodynamics Based on idea converting heat into mechanical energy he proposed psychic energy could be converted into behavior Freud s theory places central importance on dynamic unconscious psychological conflicts Freud divides human personality into three significant components id ego super ego id acts according pleasure principle demanding immediate gratification its needs regardless external environment ego then must emerge in order realistically meet wishes demands id in accordance with outside world adhering reality principle Finally superego conscience inculcates moral judgment societal rules upon ego thus forcing demands id be met not only realistically but morally superego last function personality develop embodiment parental social ideals established during childhood According Freud personality based on dynamic interactions these three components channeling release sexual libidal aggressive energies which ensues from Eros sex instinctual self preservation Thanatos death instinctual self annihilation drives respectively are major components his theory It important note that Freud s broad understanding sexuality included all kinds pleasurable feelings experienced by human body Freud proposed five psychosexual stages personality development He believed adult personality dependent upon early childhood experiences largely determined by age five Fixations that develop during infantile stage contribute adult personality behavior One Sigmund Freud s earlier associates Alfred Adler did agree with Freud that early childhood experiences are important development believed birth order may influence personality development Adler believed that oldest child was individual would set high achievement goals in order gain attention lost younger siblings were born He believed middle children were competitive ambitious He reasoned that this behavior was motivated by idea surpassing firstborn s achievements He added however that middle children were often not as concerned about glory attributed with behavior He also believed youngest would be more dependent sociable Adler finished by surmising that an only child loves being center attention matures quickly but in end fails become independent Heinz Kohut thought similarly Freud s idea transference He used narcissism as model people develop sense self Narcissism exaggerated sense one self in which one believed exist in order protect one s low self esteem sense worthlessness Kohut had significant impact on field by extending Freud s theory narcissism introducing he called self object transferences mirroring idealization In other words children need idealize emotionally sink into identify with idealized competence admired figures such as parents older siblings They also need have self worth mirrored by these people These experiences allow them thereby learn self soothing other skills that are necessary development healthy sense self Another important figure in world personality theory Karen Horney She credited with development Feminist Psychology She disagrees with Freud on some key points one being that women s personalities aren t just function Penis Envy but that girl children have separate different psychic lives unrelated they feel about fathers primary male role models She talks about three basic Neurotic needs Basic Anxiety Basic Hostility Basic Evil She posits that any anxiety an individual experiences they would have one three approaches moving toward people moving away from people moving against people It s these three that give us varying personality types characteristics She also places high premium on concepts like Overvaluation Love romantic partners Behaviorist theories edit Behaviorists explain personality in terms effects external stimuli have on behavior approaches used analyze behavioral aspect personality are known as behavioral theories learning conditioning theories These approaches were radical shift away from Freudian philosophy One major tenets this concentration personality psychology strong emphasis on scientific thinking experimentation This school thought was developed by B F Skinner put forth model which emphasized mutual interaction person organism with its environment Skinner believed children do bad things behavior obtains attention that serves as reinforcer example child cries child s crying in past has led attention These are response consequences response child crying attention that child gets reinforcing consequence According this theory people s behavior formed by processes such as operant conditioning Skinner put forward three term contingency model which helped promote analysis behavior based on Stimulus Response Consequence Model in which critical question Under which circumstances antecedent stimuli does organism engage in particular behavior response which in turn produces particular consequence Richard Herrnstein extended this theory by accounting attitudes traits An attitude develops as response strength tendency respond in presences group stimuli become stable Rather than describing conditionable traits in non behavioral language response strength in given situation accounts environmental portion Herrstein also saw traits as having large genetic biological component as do most modern behaviorists Ivan Pavlov another notable influence He well known his classical conditioning experiments involving dogs which led him discover foundation behaviorism Social cognitive theories edit In cognitive theory behavior explained as guided by cognitions e g expectations about world especially those about other people Cognitive theories are theories personality that emphasize cognitive processes such as thinking judging Albert Bandura social learning theorist suggested forces memory emotions worked in conjunction with environmental influences Bandura was known mostly his Bobo doll experiment During these experiments Bandura video taped college student kicking verbally abusing bobo doll He then showed this video class kindergarten children were getting ready go out play they entered play room they saw bobo dolls some hammers people observing these children at play saw group children beating doll He called this study his findings observational learning modeling Early examples approaches cognitive style are listed by Baron These include Witkin s work on field dependency Gardner s discovering people had consistent preference number categories they used categorise heterogeneous objects Block Petersen s work on confidence in line discrimination judgments Baron relates early development cognitive approaches personality ego psychology More central this field have been Attributional style theory dealing with different ways in which people explain events in lives This approach builds upon locus control but extends it by stating we also need consider whether people attribute stable causes variable causes global causes specific causes Various scales have been developed assess both attributional style locus control Locus control scales include those used by Rotter later by Duttweiler Nowicki Strickland Locus Control Scale Children various locus control scales specifically in health domain most famously that Kenneth Wallston his colleagues Multidimensional Health Locus Control Scale Attributional style has been assessed by Attributional Style Questionnaire Expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire Attributions Questionnaire Real Events Attributional Style Questionnaire Attributional Style Assessment Test Achievement style theory focuses upon identification an individual s Locus Control tendency such as by Rotter s evaluations was found by Cassandra Bolyard Whyte provide valuable information improving academic performance students Individuals with internal control tendencies are likely persist better academic performance levels presenting an achievement personality according Cassandra B Whyte Recognition that tendency believe that hard work persistence often results in attainment life academic goals has influenced formal educational counseling efforts with students various ages in various settings since s research about achievement Counseling aimed toward encouraging individuals design ambitious goals work toward them with recognition that are external factors that may impact often results in incorporation more positive achievement style by students employees whatever setting include higher education workplace justice programming Walter Mischel has also defended cognitive approach personality His work refers Cognitive Affective Units considers factors such as encoding stimuli affect goal setting self regulatory beliefs term Cognitive Affective Units shows his approach considers affect as well as cognition Cognitive Experiential Self Theory CEST another cognitive personality theory Developed by Seymour Epstein CEST argues that humans operate by way two independent information processing systems experiential system rational system experiential system fast emotion driven rational system slow logic driven These two systems interact determine our goals thoughts behavior Personal construct psychology PCP theory personality developed by American psychologist George Kelly in s Kelly s fundamental view personality was that people are like naive scientists see world through particular lens based on uniquely organized systems construction which they use anticipate events But people are naive scientists they sometimes employ systems construing world that are distorted by idiosyncratic experiences not applicable current social situation system construction that chronically fails characterize predict events not appropriately revised comprehend predict one s changing social world considered underlie psychopathology mental illness From theory Kelly derived psychotherapy approach also technique called Repertory Grid Interview that helped his patients uncover own constructs with minimal intervention interpretation by therapist repertory grid was later adapted various uses within organizations including decision making interpretation other people s world views Humanistic theories edit Humanistic psychology emphasizes that people have free will that this plays an active role in determining they behave Accordingly humanistic psychology focuses on subjective experiences persons as opposed forced definitive factors that determine behavior Abraham Maslow Carl Rogers were proponents this view which based on phenomenal field theory Combs Snygg Rogers Maslow were among group psychologists that worked together decade produce Journal Humanistic Psychology This journal was primarily focused on viewing individuals as whole rather than focusing solely on separate traits processes within individual Robert W White wrote book Abnormal Personality that became standard text on abnormal psychology He also investigated human need strive positive goals like competence influence counterbalance emphasis Freud on pathological elements personality development Maslow spent much his time studying he called self actualizing persons those are fulfilling themselves doing best they are capable doing Maslow believes all are interested in growth move towards self actualizing growth happiness satisfaction views Many these people demonstrate trend in dimensions personalities Characteristics self actualizers according Maslow include four key dimensions Awareness maintaining constant enjoyment awe life These individuals often experienced peak experience He defined peak experience as an intensification any experience degree loss transcendence self peak experience one in which an individual perceives an expansion themselves detects unity meaningfulness in life Intense concentration on an activity one involved in such as running marathon may invoke peak experience Reality problem centered having tendency be concerned with problems in surroundings Acceptance Spontaneity accepting surroundings cannot be changed Unhostile sense humor democratic do not take kindly joking about others which can be viewed as offensive They have friends all backgrounds religions hold very close friendships Maslow Rogers emphasized view person as an active creative experiencing human being lives in present subjectively responds current perceptions relationships encounters They disagree with dark pessimistic outlook those in Freudian psychoanalysis ranks but rather view humanistic theories as positive optimistic proposals which stress tendency human personality toward growth self actualization This progressing self will remain center its constantly changing world world that will help mold self but not necessarily confine it Rather self has opportunity maturation based on its encounters with this world This understanding attempts reduce acceptance hopeless redundancy Humanistic therapy typically relies on client information past its effect on present therefore client dictates type guidance therapist may initiate This allows an individualized approach therapy Rogers found patients differ in they respond other people Rogers tried model particular approach therapy he stressed reflective empathetic response This response type takes client s viewpoint reflects back feeling context it An example reflective response would be It seems are feeling anxious about upcoming marriage This response type seeks clarify therapist s understanding while also encouraging client think more deeply seek fully understand feelings they have expressed Biopsychological theories edit False color represent tations cere bral fiber path ways affect ed in Phineas Gage s accident per Van Horn et al Biology plays very important role in development personality study biological level in personality psychology focuses primarily on identifying role genetic determinants they mold individual personalities Some earliest thinking about possible biological bases personality grew out case Phineas Gage In an accident large iron rod was driven through Gage s head his personality apparently changed as result although descriptions these psychological changes are usually exaggerated In general patients with brain damage have been difficult find study In s researchers began use electroencephalography EEG positron emission tomography PET more recently functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI which now most widely used imaging technique help localize personality traits in brain Genetic basis personality edit Ever since Human Genome Project allowed much more in depth understanding genetics has been an ongoing controversy involving heritability personality traits environmental vs genetic influence on personality human genome known play role in development personality Previously genetic personality studies focused on specific genes correlating specific personality traits Today s view gene personality relationship focuses primarily on activation expression genes related personality forms part referred as behavioural genetics Genes provide numerous options varying cells be expressed however environment determines which these are activated Many studies have noted this relationship in varying ways in which our bodies can develop but interaction between genes shaping our minds personality also relevant this biological relationship DNA environment interactions are important in development personality this relationship determines part DNA code actually made into proteins that will become part an individual While different choices are made available by genome in end environment ultimate determinant becomes activated Small changes in DNA in individuals are lead uniqueness every person as well as differences in looks abilities brain functioning all factors that culminate develop cohesive personality Cattell Eysenck have proposed that genetics have strong influence on personality large part evidence collected linking genetics environment personality have come from twin studies This twin method compares levels similarity in personality using genetically identical twins One first these twin studies measured pairs twins studied numerous personality traits determined that identical twins are most similar in general abilities Personality similarities were found be less related self concepts goals interests Twin studies have also been important in creation five factor personality model neuroticism extraversion openness agreeableness conscientiousness Neuroticism extraversion are two most widely studied traits person that may fall into extravert category can display characteristics such as impulsiveness sociability activeness person falling into neuroticism category may be more likely be moody anxious irritable Identical twins however have higher correlations in personality traits than fraternal twins One study measuring genetic influence on twins in five different countries found that correlations identical twins were while fraternal they were about It suggested that heredity environment interact determine one s personality Evolutionary theory edit Charles Darwin founder theory evolution species evolutionary approach personality psychology based on this theory This theory examines individual personality differences are based on natural selection Through natural selection organisms change over time through adaptation selection Traits are developed certain genes come into expression based on an organism s environment these traits aid in an organism s survival reproduction Polymorphisms such as gender blood type are forms diversity which evolve benefit species as whole theory evolution has wide ranging implications on personality psychology Personality viewed through lens evolutionary psychology places great deal emphasis on specific traits that are most likely aid in survival reproduction such as conscientiousness sociability emotional stability dominance social aspects personality can be seen through an evolutionary perspective Specific character traits develop are selected they play an important complex role in social hierarchy organisms Such characteristics this social hierarchy include sharing important resources family mating interactions harm help organisms can bestow upon one another Drive theories edit In s John Dollard Neal Elgar Miller met at Yale University began an attempt integrate drives see Drive theory into theory personality basing themselves on work Clark Hull They began with premise that personality could be equated with habitual responses exhibited by an individual habits From they determined that these habitual responses were built on secondary acquired drives Secondary drives are internal needs directing behaviour an individual that results from learning Acquired drives are learned by large in manner described by classical conditioning we are in certain environment experience strong response stimulus we internalize cues from said environment we find ourselves in an environment with similar cues we begin act in anticipation similar stimulus Thus we are likely experience anxiety in an environment with cues similar one we have experienced pain fear such as dentist s office Secondary drives are built on primary drives which are biologically driven motivate us act with no prior learning process such as hunger thirst need sexual activity However secondary drives are thought represent more specific elaborations primary drives behind which functions original primary drive continue exist Thus primary drives fear pain exist behind acquired drive anxiety Secondary drives can be based on multiple primary drives even in other secondary drives This said give them strength persistence Examples include need money which was conceptualized as arising from multiple primary drives such as drive food warmth as well as from secondary drives such as imitativeness drive do as others do anxiety Secondary drives vary based on social conditions under which they were learned such as culture Dollard Miller used example food stating that primary drive hunger manifested itself behind learned secondary drive an appetite specific type food which was dependent on culture individual Secondary drives are also explicitly social representing manner in which we convey our primary drives others Indeed many primary drives are actively repressed by society such as sexual drive Dollard Miller believed that acquisition secondary drives was essential childhood development As children develop they learn not act on primary drives such as hunger but acquire secondary drives through reinforcement Friedman Schustack describe an example such developmental changes stating that if an infant engaging in an active orientation towards others brings about fulfillment primary drives such as being fed having diaper changed they will develop secondary drive pursue similar interactions with others perhaps leading an individual being more gregarious Dollard Miller s belief in importance acquired drives led them reconceive Sigmund Freud s theory psychosexual development They found themselves be in agreement with timing Freud used but believed that these periods corresponded successful learning certain secondary drives Dollard Miller gave many examples secondary drives impact our habitual responses by extension our personalities including anger social conformity imitativeness anxiety name few In case anxiety Dollard Miller note that people generalize situation in which they experience anxiety drive will experience anxiety far more than they should These people are often anxious all time anxiety becomes part personality This example shows drive theory can have ties with other theories personality many them look at trait neuroticism emotional stability in people which strongly linked anxiety Personality tests edit are two major types personality tests projective objective Projective tests assume personality primarily unconscious assess individuals by they respond an ambiguous stimulus such as an ink blot Projective tests have been in use about years continue be used today Examples such tests include Rorschach test Thematic Apperception Test Rorschach Test involves showing an individual series note cards with ambiguous ink blots on them individual being tested asked provide interpretations blots on cards by stating everything that ink blot may resemble based on personal interpretation therapist then analyzes responses Rules scoring test have been covered in manuals that cover wide variety characteristics such as content originality response location perceived images several other factors Using these specific scoring methods therapist will then attempt relate test responses attributes individual s personality unique characteristics idea that unconscious needs will come out in person s response e g an aggressive person may see images destruction Thematic Apperception Test also known as TAT involves presenting individuals with vague pictures scenes asking them tell story based on they see Common examples these scenes include images that may suggest family relationships specific situations such as father son man woman in bedroom Responses are analyzed common themes Responses unique an individual are theoretically meant indicate underlying thoughts processes potentially conflicts present within individual Responses are believed be directly linked unconscious motives very little empirical evidence available support these methods Objective tests assume personality consciously accessible that it can be measured by self report questionnaires Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests be more valid reliable than projective tests Critics have pointed Forer effect suggest some these appear be more accurate discriminating than they really are Issues with these tests include false reporting no way tell if an individual answering question honestly accurately Myers Briggs Type Indicator also known as MBTI self reporting questionnaire based on Carl Jung s Type theory Personality theory assessment criteria edit Verifiability theory should be formulated in such way that concepts suggestions hypotheses involved in it are defined clearly unambiguously logically related each other Heuristic value extent theory stimulates scientists conduct further research Internal consistency theory should be free from internal contradictions Economy fewer concepts assumptions required by theory explain any phenomenon better it Hjelle Larry Personality Theories Basic Assumptions Research Applications Psychology has traditionally defined personality through its behavioral patterns more recently with neuroscientific studies brain In recent years some psychologists have turned study inner experiences insight into personality as well as individuality Inner experiences are thoughts feelings an immediate phenomenon Another term used define inner experiences qualia Being able understand inner experiences assists in understanding humans behave act respond Defining personality using inner experiences has been expanding due fact that solely relying on behavioral principles explain one s character may seem incomplete Behavioral methods allow subject be observed by an observer whereas with inner experiences subject its own observer Methods measuring inner experience edit Descriptive experience sampling DES developed by psychologist Russel Hurlburt This an idiographic method that used help examine inner experiences This method relies on an introspective technique that allows an individual s inner experiences characteristics be described measured beep notifies subject record experience at that exact moment hours later an interview given based on all experiences recorded DES has been used in subjects that have been diagnosed with schizophrenia depression It has also been crucial studying inner experiences those have been diagnosed with common psychiatric diseases Articulated thoughts in stimulated situations ATSS ATSS paradigm which was created as an alternative TA think aloud method This method assumes that people have continuous internal dialogues that can be naturally attended ATSS also assesses person s inner thoughts as they verbalize cognitions In this procedure subjects listen scenario via video audio player are asked imagine that they are in that specific situation Later they are asked articulate thoughts as they occur in reaction playing scenario This method useful in studying emotional experience given that scenarios used can influence specific emotions Most importantly method has contributed study personality In study conducted by Rayburn Davison subjects thoughts empathy toward anti gay hate crimes were evaluated researchers found that participants showed more aggressive intentions towards offender in scenarios which mimicked hate crimes Experimental method This method an experimental paradigm used study human experiences involved in studies sensation perception learning memory motivation biological psychology experimental psychologist usually deals with intact organisms although studies are often conducted with organisms modified by surgery radiation drug treatment long standing deprivations various kinds with organisms that naturally present organic abnormalities emotional disorders Economists psychologists have developed variety experimental methodologies elicit assess individual attitudes each emotion differs each individual results are then gathered quantified conclude if specific experiences have any common factors This method used seek clarity experience remove any biases help understand meaning behind experience see if it can be generalized See also edit Clinical psychology Epigenetics in psychology Four temperaments Holland Codes Individual differences
