algorismus Al Khw rizm Arabic Persian c was Persian mathematician astronomer geographer scholar in House Wisdom in Baghdad whose name means native Khwarazm region that was part Greater Iran now in Uzbekistan About al Khwarizmi wrote an Arabic language treatise on Hindu Arabic numeral system which was translated into Latin during th century under title Algoritmi de numero Indorum This title means Algoritmi on numbers Indians Algoritmi was translator s Latinization Al Khwarizmi s name Al Khwarizmi was most widely read mathematician in Europe in late Middle Ages primarily through another his books Algebra In late medieval Latin algorismus English algorism corruption his name simply meant decimal number system In th century under influence Greek word number cf arithmetic Latin word was altered algorithmus corresponding English term algorithm first attested in th century modern sense was introduced in th century In English it was first used in about then by Chaucer in English adopted French term but it wasn t until late th century that algorithm took on meaning that it has in modern English Another early use word from in manual titled Carmen de Algorismo composed by Alexandre de Villedieu It begins with Haec algorismus ars praesens dicitur in qua Talibus Indorum fruimur bis quinque figuris which translates Algorism art by which at present we use those Indian figures which

view on definition algorithm see Algorithm characterizations An informal definition could be set rules that precisely defines sequence operations which would include all computer programs including programs that do not perform numeric calculations example any prescribed bureaucratic procedure In general program only an algorithm if it stops eventually prototypical example an algorithm Euclidean algorithm which used determine maximum common divisor two integers an example are others described by flowchart above as an example in later section Boolos Jeffrey offer an informal meaning word algorithm in following quotation No human being can write fast enough long enough small enough smaller smaller without limit d be trying write on molecules on atoms on electrons list all members an enumerably infinite set by writing out names one after another in some notation But humans can do something equally useful in case certain enumerably infinite sets They can give explicit instructions determining nth member set arbitrary finite n Such instructions are be given quite explicitly in form in which they could be followed by computing machine by human capable carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols An enumerably infinite set one whose elements can be put into one one correspondence with integers Thus Boolos Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions process that creates output integers from an arbitrary input integer integers that in theory can be arbitrarily large example an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as y m n i e two arbitrary input variables m n that produce an output y but various authors attempts define notion indicate that word implies much more than this something on order addition example Precise instructions in language understood by computer fast efficient good process that specifies moves computer machine human equipped with necessary internally contained information capabilities find decode then process arbitrary input integers symbols m n symbols effectively produce in reasonable time output integer y at specified place in specified format concept algorithm also used define notion decidability notion that central explaining formal systems come into being starting from small set axioms rules In logic time that an algorithm requires complete cannot be measured as it not apparently related customary physical dimension From such uncertainties that characterize ongoing work stems unavailability definition algorithm that suits both concrete in some sense abstract usage term Formalization edit Algorithms are essential way computers process data Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail specific instructions computer should perform in specific order carry out specified task such as calculating employees paychecks printing students report cards Thus an algorithm can be considered be any sequence operations that can be simulated by Turing complete system Authors assert this thesis include Minsky Savage Gurevich Minsky But we will also maintain with Turing that any procedure which could naturally be called effective can in fact be realized by simple machine Although this may seem extreme arguments in its favor are hard refute Gurevich Turing s informal argument in favor his thesis justifies stronger thesis every algorithm can be simulated by Turing machine according Savage an algorithm computational process defined by Turing machine Turing machines can define computational processes that do not terminate informal definitions algorithms generally require that algorithm always terminates This requirement renders task deciding whether formal procedure an algorithm impossible in general case due major theorem Computability Theory known as Halting Problem Typically an algorithm associated with processing information data can be read from an input source written an output device stored further processing Stored data are regarded as part internal state entity performing algorithm In practice state stored in one more data structures some these computational process algorithm must be rigorously defined specified in way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise This means that any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with case by case criteria each case must be clear computable an algorithm precise list precise steps order computation always crucial functioning algorithm Instructions are usually assumed be listed explicitly are described as starting from top going down bottom an idea that described more formally by flow control So far discussion on formalization an algorithm has assumed premises imperative programming This most common conception one which attempts describe task in discrete mechanical means Unique this conception formalized algorithms assignment operation which sets value variable It derives from intuition memory as scratchpad An example such an assignment can be found below some alternate conceptions constitutes an algorithm see functional programming logic programming Expressing algorithms edit Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds notation including natural languages pseudocode flowcharts drakon charts programming languages control tables processed by interpreters Natural language expressions algorithms tend be verbose ambiguous are rarely used complex technical algorithms Pseudocode flowcharts drakon charts control tables are structured ways express algorithms that avoid many ambiguities common in statements based on natural language Programming languages are primarily intended expressing algorithms in form that can be executed by computer but are also often used as way define document algorithms wide variety representations possible one can express given Turing machine program as sequence machine tables see finite state machine state transition table control table more as flowcharts drakon charts see state diagram more as form rudimentary machine code assembly code called sets quadruples see Turing machine more Representations algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels Turing machine description as follows High level description prose describe an algorithm ignoring implementation details At this level we do not need mention machine manages its tape head Implementation description prose used define way

like computer hardware are considered technology Elegant compact programs good fast programs notion simplicity elegance appears informally in Knuth precisely in Chaitin Knuth we want good algorithms in some loosely defined aesthetic sense One criterion length time taken perform algorithm Other criteria are adaptability algorithm computers its simplicity elegance etc Chaitin program elegant by which mean that it s smallest possible program producing output that it does Chaitin prefaces his definition with ll show can t prove that program elegant such proof would solve Halting problem ibid Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm given function multiple algorithms may exist This true even without expanding available instruction set available programmer Rogers observes that It important distinguish between notion algorithm i e procedure notion function computable by algorithm i e mapping yielded by procedure same function may have several different algorithms Unfortunately may be tradeoff between goodness speed elegance compactness an elegant program may take more steps complete computation than one less elegant An example that uses Euclid s algorithm

immediately take pen paper work through an example But about simulation execution real thing programmer must translate algorithm into language that simulator computer computor can effectively execute Stone gives an example this computing roots quadratic equation computor must know take square root If they don t then algorithm be effective must provide set rules extracting square root This means that programmer must know language that effective relative target computing agent computer computor But model should be used simulation Van Emde Boas observes even if we base complexity theory on abstract instead concrete machines arbitrariness choice model remains It at this point that notion simulation enters speed being measured instruction set matters example subprogram in Euclid s

no numerical examples Nicomachus gives example subtract less from greater left then again subtract from this same this possible left subtract this from left from which again subtract this possible left but cannot be subtracted from Heath comments that last phrase curious but meaning it obvious enough as also meaning phrase about ending at one same number Heath Euclid s algorithm compute greatest common divisor GCD two numbers appears as Proposition II in Book VII Elementary Number Theory his Elements Euclid poses problem thus Given two numbers not prime one another find greatest common measure He defines number be multitude composed units counting number positive integer not including zero measure place shorter measuring length s successively q times along longer length l until remaining portion r less than shorter length s In modern words remainder r l q s q being quotient remainder r modulus integer fractional part left over after division Euclid s method succeed starting lengths must satisfy two requirements i lengths must not be zero AND ii subtraction must be proper i e test must guarantee that smaller two numbers subtracted from larger two can be equal so subtraction yields zero Euclid s original proof adds third requirement two lengths must not be prime one another Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct reductio ad absurdum proof that two numbers common measure in fact greatest While Nicomachus algorithm same as Euclid s numbers are prime one another it yields number common measure So be precise following really Nicomachus algorithm

one number zero both numbers are zero Inelegant computes forever in all cases Elegant computes forever happens if negative numbers are entered Fractional numbers If input numbers i e domain function computed by algorithm program include only positive integers including zero then failures at zero indicate that algorithm program that instantiates it partial function rather than total function notable failure due exceptions Ariane Flight rocket failure June Proof program correctness by use mathematical induction Knuth demonstrates application mathematical induction an extended version Euclid s algorithm he proposes general method applicable proving validity any algorithm Tausworthe proposes that measure complexity program be length its correctness proof Measuring improving Euclid algorithms edit Elegance compactness versus goodness speed With only six core instructions Elegant clear winner compared Inelegant at thirteen instructions However Inelegant faster it arrives at HALT in fewer steps Algorithm analysis indicates this case Elegant does two conditional tests in every subtraction loop whereas Inelegant only does one As algorithm usually requires many loop throughs on average much time wasted doing B test that needed only after remainder computed Can algorithms be improved Once programmer judges program fit effective that it computes function intended by its author then question becomes can it be improved compactness Inelegant can be improved by elimination five steps But Chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by generalized algorithm rather it can only be done heuristically i e by exhaustive search examples be found at Busy beaver trial error cleverness insight application inductive reasoning etc Observe that steps are repeated in steps Comparison with Elegant provides hint that these steps together with steps can be eliminated This reduces number core instructions from thirteen eight which makes it more elegant than Elegant at nine steps speed Elegant can be improved by moving B test outside two subtraction loops This change calls addition three instructions B GOTO Now Elegant computes example numbers faster whether this always case any given B R S would require detailed analysis Algorithmic analysis edit Main article Analysis algorithms It frequently important know much particular resource such as time storage

gcd B Recursive C implementation Euclid s algorithm from above flowchart Recursion recursive algorithm one that invokes makes reference itself repeatedly until certain condition also known as termination condition matches which method common functional programming Iterative algorithms use repetitive constructs like loops sometimes additional data structures like stacks solve given problems Some problems are naturally suited one implementation other example towers Hanoi well understood using recursive implementation Every recursive version has an equivalent but possibly more less complex iterative version vice versa Logical An algorithm may be viewed as controlled logical deduction This notion may be expressed as Algorithm logic control logic component expresses axioms that may be used in computation control component determines way in which deduction applied axioms This basis logic programming paradigm In pure logic programming languages control component fixed algorithms are specified by supplying only logic component appeal this approach elegant semantics change in axioms produces well defined change in algorithm Serial parallel distributed Algorithms are usually discussed with assumption that computers execute one instruction an algorithm at time Those computers are sometimes called serial computers An algorithm designed such an environment called serial algorithm as opposed parallel algorithms distributed algorithms Parallel algorithms take advantage computer architectures several processors can work on problem at same time whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with computer network Parallel distributed algorithms divide problem into more symmetrical asymmetrical subproblems collect results back together resource consumption in such algorithms not only processor cycles on each processor but also communication overhead between processors Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently but communication overhead expensive Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable Some problems have no parallel algorithms are called inherently serial problems Deterministic non deterministic Deterministic algorithms solve problem with exact decision at every step algorithm whereas non deterministic algorithms solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through use heuristics Exact approximate While many algorithms reach an exact solution approximation algorithms seek an approximation that closer true solution approximation can be reached by either using deterministic random strategy Such algorithms have practical value many hard problems One examples an approximate algorithm Knapsack problem set given items Its goal pack knapsack get maximum total value Each item has some weight some value Total weight that can be carried no more than some fixed number X So solution must consider weights items as well as value Quantum algorithm They run on realistic model quantum computation term usually used those algorithms which seem inherently quantum use some essential feature Quantum computing such as quantum superposition quantum entanglement By design paradigm edit Another way classifying algorithms by design methodology paradigm certain number paradigms each different from other Furthermore each these categories includes many different types algorithms Some common paradigms are Brute force exhaustive search This naive method trying every possible solution see which best Divide conquer divide conquer algorithm repeatedly reduces an instance problem one more smaller instances same problem usually recursively until instances are small enough solve easily One such example divide conquer merge sorting Sorting can be done on each segment data after dividing data into segments sorting entire data can be obtained in conquer phase by merging segments simpler variant divide conquer called decrease conquer algorithm that solves an identical subproblem uses solution this subproblem solve bigger problem Divide conquer divides problem into multiple subproblems so conquer stage more complex than decrease conquer algorithms An example decrease conquer algorithm binary search algorithm Search enumeration Many problems such as playing chess can be modeled as problems on graphs graph exploration algorithm specifies rules moving around graph useful such problems This category also includes search algorithms branch bound enumeration backtracking Randomized algorithm Such algorithms make some choices randomly pseudo randomly They can be very useful in finding approximate solutions problems finding exact solutions can be impractical see heuristic method below some these problems it known that fastest approximations must involve some randomness Whether randomized algorithms with polynomial time complexity can be fastest algorithms some problems an open question known as P versus NP problem are two large classes such algorithms Monte Carlo algorithms return correct answer with high probability E g RP subclass these that run in polynomial time Las Vegas algorithms always return correct answer but running time only probabilistically bound e g ZPP Reduction complexity This technique involves solving difficult problem by transforming it into better known problem which we have hopefully asymptotically optimal algorithms goal find reducing algorithm whose complexity not dominated by resulting reduced algorithm s example one selection algorithm finding median in an unsorted list involves first sorting list expensive portion then pulling out middle element in sorted list cheap portion This technique also known as transform conquer Back tracking In this approach multiple solutions are built incrementally abandoned it determined that they cannot lead valid full solution Optimization problems edit optimization problems more specific classification algorithms an algorithm such problems may fall into one more general categories described above as well as into one following Linear programming searching optimal solutions linear function bound linear equality inequality constraints constraints problem can be used directly in producing optimal solutions are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category such as popular simplex algorithm Problems that can be solved with linear programming include maximum flow problem directed graphs If problem additionally requires that one more unknowns must be an integer then it classified in integer programming linear programming algorithm can solve such problem if it can be proved that all restrictions integer values are superficial i e solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway In general case specialized algorithm an algorithm that finds approximate solutions used depending on difficulty problem Dynamic programming problem shows optimal substructures meaning optimal solution problem can be constructed from optimal solutions subproblems overlapping subproblems meaning same subproblems are used solve many different problem instances quicker approach called dynamic programming avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed example Floyd Warshall algorithm shortest path goal from vertex in weighted graph can be found by using shortest path goal from all adjacent vertices Dynamic programming memoization go together main difference between dynamic programming divide conquer that subproblems are more less independent in divide conquer whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming difference between dynamic programming straightforward recursion in caching memoization recursive calls subproblems are independent no repetition memoization does not help hence dynamic programming not solution all complex problems By using memoization maintaining table subproblems already solved dynamic programming reduces exponential nature many problems polynomial complexity greedy method greedy algorithm similar dynamic programming algorithm in that it works by examining substructures in this case not problem but given solution Such algorithms start with some solution which may be given have been constructed in some way improve it by making small modifications some problems they can find optimal solution while others they stop at local optima that at solutions that cannot be improved by algorithm but are not optimum most popular use greedy algorithms finding minimal spanning tree finding optimal solution possible with this method Huffman Tree Kruskal Prim Sollin are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem heuristic method In optimization problems heuristic algorithms can be used find solution close optimal solution in cases finding optimal solution impractical These algorithms work by getting closer closer optimal solution as they progress In principle if run an infinite amount time they will find optimal solution merit that they can find solution very close optimal solution in relatively short time Such algorithms include local search tabu search simulated annealing genetic algorithms Some them like simulated

identical Post s formulation J Barkley Rosser s definition effective method in terms machine S C Kleene s proposal precursor Church thesis that he called Thesis few years later Kleene s renaming his Thesis Church s Thesis proposing Turing s Thesis Emil Post Alan Turing edit Emil Post described actions computer human being as follows two concepts are involved that symbol space in which work leading from problem answer be carried out fixed unalterable set directions His symbol space would be two way infinite sequence spaces boxes problem solver worker move work in this symbol space being capable being in operating in but one box at time box admit but two possible conditions i e being empty unmarked having single mark in it say vertical stroke One box be singled out called starting point specific problem be given in symbolic form by finite number boxes i e INPUT being marked with stroke Likewise answer i e OUTPUT be given in symbolic form by such configuration marked boxes set directions applicable general problem sets up deterministic process applied each specific problem This process terminates only it comes direction type C i e STOP See more at Post Turing machine Alan Turing s statue at Bletchley Park Alan Turing s work preceded that Stibitz it unknown whether Stibitz knew work Turing Turing s biographer believed that Turing s use typewriter like model derived from youthful interest Alan had dreamt inventing typewriters as boy Mrs Turing had typewriter he could well have begun by asking himself was meant by calling typewriter mechanical Given prevalence Morse code telegraphy ticker tape machines teletypewriters we might conjecture that all were influences Turing his model computation now called Turing machine begins as did Post with an analysis human computer that he whittles down simple set basic motions states mind But he continues step further creates machine as model computation numbers Computing normally done by writing certain symbols on paper We may suppose this paper divided into squares like child s arithmetic book assume then that computation carried out on one dimensional paper i e on tape divided into squares shall also suppose that number symbols which may be printed finite behavior computer at any moment determined by symbols which he observing his state mind at that moment We may suppose that bound B number symbols squares which computer can observe at one moment If he wishes observe more he must use successive observations We will also suppose that number states mind which need be taken into account finite Let us imagine that operations performed by computer be split up into simple operations which are so elementary that it not easy imagine them further divided Turing s reduction yields following simple operations must therefore include Changes symbol on one observed squares b Changes one squares observed another square within L squares one previously observed squares It may be that some these change necessarily invoke change state mind most general single operation must therefore be taken be one following possible change symbol together with possible change state mind B possible change b observed squares together with possible change state mind We may now construct machine do work this computer few years later Turing expanded his analysis thesis definition with this forceful expression it function said be effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process Though it fairly easy get an intuitive grasp this idea it nevertheless desirable have some more definite mathematical expressible definition he discusses history definition pretty much as presented above with respect G del Herbrand Kleene Church Turing Post We may take this statement literally understanding by purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by machine It possible give mathematical description in certain normal form structures these machines development these ideas leads author s definition computable function an identification computability with effective calculability We shall use expression computable function mean function calculable by machine we let effectively calculable refer intuitive idea without particular identification with any one these definitions J B Rosser S C Kleene edit J Barkley Rosser defined an effective mathematical method in following manner italicization added Effective method used here in rather special sense method each step which precisely determined which certain produce answer in finite number steps With this special meaning three different precise definitions have been given date his footnote see discussion immediately below simplest these state due Post Turing says essentially that an effective method solving certain sets problems exists if one can build machine which will then solve any problem set with no human intervention beyond inserting question later reading answer All three definitions are equivalent so it doesn t matter which one used Moreover fact that all three are equivalent very strong argument correctness any one Rosser Rosser s footnote No references work Church Kleene definition definability in particular Church s use it in his An Unsolvable Problem Elementary Number Theory Herbrand G del use recursion in particular G del s use in his famous paper On Formally Undecidable Propositions Principia Mathematica Related Systems Post Turing in mechanism models computation Stephen C Kleene defined as his now famous Thesis known as Church Turing thesis But he did this in following context boldface in original Algorithmic theories In setting up complete algorithmic theory we do describe procedure performable each set values independent variables which procedure necessarily terminates in such manner that from outcome we can read definite answer yes no question predicate value true Kleene History after edit number efforts have been directed toward further
