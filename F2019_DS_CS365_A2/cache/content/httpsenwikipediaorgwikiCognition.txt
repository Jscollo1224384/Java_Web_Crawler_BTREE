intellectual functions processes such as attention formation knowledge memory working memory judgment evaluation reasoning computation problem solving decision making comprehension production language Cognitive processes use existing knowledge generate new knowledge Cognitive processes are analyzed from different perspectives within different contexts notably in fields linguistics anesthesia neuroscience psychiatry psychology education philosophy anthropology biology systemics logic computer science These other different approaches analysis cognition are synthesised in developing field

Recent developments Metacognition See also References Further reading External links Etymology edit word cognition comes from Latin verb cognosco con with gn sc know itself cognate Greek verb gi g n sko meaning know perceive citation needed meaning conceptualize recognize beginnings studies on cognition edit word cognition dates back th century it meant thinking awareness Attention cognitive processes came about more than eighteen centuries earlier however beginning with Aristotle BC his interest in inner workings mind they affect human experience Aristotle focused on cognitive areas pertaining memory perception mental imagery He placed great importance on ensuring that his studies were based on empirical evidence that scientific information that gathered through observation conscientious experimentation Two millennia later groundwork modern concepts cognition was laid during Enlightenment by thinkers such as John Locke Dugald Stewart sought develop model mind in which ideas were acquired remembered manipulated During early nineteenth century cognitive models were developed both in philosophy particularly by authors writing about philosophy mind within medicine especially by physicians seeking understand cure madness Within Britain these models were studied in academy by scholars such as James Sully at University College London they were even used by politicians considering national education act As psychology emerged as burgeoning field study in Europe then gained following in America other scientists like Wilhelm Wundt Herman Ebbinghaus Mary Whiton Calkins William James would offer contributions study human cognition Wilhelm Wundt emphasized notion he called introspection examining inner feelings an individual With introspection subject had be careful describe feelings in most objective manner possible in order Wundt find information scientific Though Wundt s contributions are by no means minimal modern psychologists find his methods be quite subjective choose rely on more objective procedures experimentation make conclusions about human cognitive process Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted cognitive studies that mainly examined function capacity human memory Ebbinghaus developed his own experiment in which he constructed over syllables made out nonexistent words instance EAS He then examined his own personal ability learn these non words He purposely chose non words as opposed real words control influence pre existing experience on words might symbolize thus enabling easier recollection them Ebbinghaus observed hypothesized number variables that may have affected his ability learn recall non words he created One reasons he concluded was amount time between presentation list stimuli recitation recall same Ebbinghaus was first record plot learning curve forgetting curve His work heavily influenced study serial position its effect on memory discussed in subsequent sections Mary Whiton Calkins was an influential American pioneer in realm psychology Her work also focused on human memory capacity common theory called recency effect can be attributed studies that she conducted recency effect also discussed in subsequent experiment section tendency individuals be able accurately recollect final items presented in sequence stimuli Calkin s theory closely related aforementioned study conclusion memory experiments conducted by Hermann Ebbinghaus William James another pivotal figure in history cognitive science James was quite discontent with Wundt s emphasis on introspection Ebbinghaus use nonsense stimuli He instead chose focus on human learning experience in everyday life its importance study cognition James most significant contribution study theory cognition was his textbook Principles Psychology that preliminarily examines aspects cognition such as perception memory reasoning attention Psychology edit mind makes generalization such as concept tree it extracts similarities from numerous examples simplification enables higher level thinking abstract thinking In psychology term cognition usually used within an information processing view an individual s psychological functions see cognitivism it same in cognitive engineering in branch social psychology called social cognition term used explain attitudes attribution group dynamics Human cognition conscious unconscious concrete abstract as well as intuitive like knowledge language conceptual like model language It encompasses processes such as memory association concept formation pattern recognition language attention perception action problem solving mental imagery Traditionally emotion was not thought as cognitive process but now much research being undertaken examine cognitive psychology emotion research also focused on one s awareness one s own strategies methods cognition which called metacognition While few people would deny that cognitive processes are function brain cognitive theory will not necessarily make reference brain biological processes compare neurocognitive It may purely describe behavior in terms information flow function Relatively recent fields study such as neuropsychology aim bridge this gap using cognitive paradigms understand brain implements information processing functions see also cognitive neuroscience understand pure information processing systems e g computers can simulate human cognition see also artificial intelligence branch psychology that studies brain injury infer normal cognitive function called cognitive neuropsychology links cognition evolutionary demands are studied through investigation animal cognition Piaget s theory cognitive development edit years sociologists psychologists have conducted studies on cognitive development construction human thought mental processes Jean Piaget was one most important influential people in field Developmental Psychology He believed that humans are unique in comparison animals we have capacity do abstract symbolic reasoning His work can be compared Lev Vygotsky Sigmund Freud Erik Erikson were also great contributors in field Developmental Psychology Today Piaget known studying cognitive development in children He studied his own three children intellectual development came up with theory that describes stages children pass through during development Stage Age Period Description Sensorimotor stage Infancy years Intelligence present motor activity but no symbols knowledge developing yet limited knowledge based on experiences interactions mobility allows child learn new things some language skills are developed at end this stage goal develop object permanence achieves basic understanding causality time space Pre operational stage Toddler Early

operational stage Adolescence Adulthood years on Logical use symbols related abstract concepts Acquires flexibility in thinking as well as capacities abstract thinking mental hypothesis testing can consider possible alternatives in complex reasoning problem solving Common experiments on human cognition edit Serial position serial position experiment meant test theory memory that states that information given in serial manner we tend remember information in beginning sequence called primacy effect information in end sequence called recency effect Consequently information given in middle sequence typically forgotten not recalled as easily This study predicts that recency effect stronger than primacy effect information that most recently learned still in working memory asked be recalled Information that learned first still has go through retrieval process This experiment focuses on human memory processes Word superiority word superiority experiment presents subject with word letter by itself brief period time i e ms they are then asked recall letter that was in particular location in word By theory subject should be better able correctly recall letter it was presented in word than it was presented in isolation This experiment focuses on human speech language Brown Peterson In Brown Peterson experiment participants are briefly presented with trigram in one particular version experiment they are then given distractor task asking them identify whether sequence words are in fact words non words due being misspelled etc After distractor task they are asked recall trigram from before distractor task In theory longer distractor task harder it will be participants correctly recall trigram This experiment focuses on human short term memory Memory span During memory span experiment each subject presented with sequence stimuli same kind words depicting objects numbers letters that sound similar letters that sound dissimilar After being presented with stimuli subject asked recall sequence stimuli that they were given in exact order in which it was given In one particular version experiment if subject recalled list correctly list length was increased by one that type material vice versa if it was recalled incorrectly theory that people have memory span about seven items numbers same letters that sound dissimilar short words memory span projected be shorter with letters that sound similar with longer words Visual search In one version visual search experiment participant presented with window that displays circles squares scattered across it participant identify whether green circle on window In featured search subject presented with several trial windows that have blue squares circles one green circle no green circle in it at all In conjunctive search subject presented with trial windows that have blue circles green squares present absent green circle whose presence participant asked identify expected that in feature searches reaction time that time it takes participant identify whether green circle present not should not change as number distractors increases Conjunctive searches target absent should have longer reaction time than conjunctive searches target present theory that in feature searches it easy spot target if it absent difference in color between target distractors In conjunctive searches target absent reaction time increases subject has look at each shape determine whether it target not some distractors if not all them are same color as target stimuli Conjunctive searches target present take less time if target found search between each shape stops Knowledge representation semantic network knowledge representation systems has been studied in various paradigms One oldest paradigms leveling sharpening stories as they are repeated from memory studied by Bartlett semantic differential used factor analysis determine main meanings words finding that value goodness words first factor More controlled experiments examine categorical relationships words in free recall hierarchical structure words has been explicitly mapped in George Miller s Wordnet More dynamic models semantic networks have been created tested with neural network experiments based on computational systems such as latent semantic analysis LSA Bayesian analysis multidimensional factor analysis semantics meaning words
