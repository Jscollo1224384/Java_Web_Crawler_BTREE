concentrated into relatively short time interval competition involving number matches each involving subset competitors with overall tournament winner determined based on combined results these individual matches These are common in those sports games each match must involve small number competitors often precisely two as in most team sports racket sports combat sports many card games board games many forms competitive debating Such tournaments allow large numbers compete against each other in spite restriction on numbers in single match These two senses are distinct All golf tournaments meet first definition but while match play tournaments meet second stroke play tournaments do not since are no distinct matches within tournament In contrast association football leagues like Premier League are tournaments in second sense but not first having matches spread across many states in past in pll over period up season Many tournaments meet both definitions example Wimbledon tennis championship Tournaments are temporally demarcated events participation in which confers levels status prestige amongst all participating members tournament match tie fixture heat may involve multiple game matches rubbers legs between competitors example in Davis Cup tennis tournament tie between two nations involves five rubbers between nations players team that wins most rubbers wins tie In later rounds UEFA Champions League each fixture played over two legs scores each leg are added team with higher aggregate score wins fixture with away goals used as tiebreaker penalty shoot out if away goals cannot determine winner game Contents Knockout tournaments Group tournaments Multi stage tournaments Promotion relegation Bridge tournaments Poker tournaments Alternatives tournament systems Tournaments value See also References Knockout tournaments edit knockout tournament elimination tournament divided into successive rounds each competitor plays in at least one fixture per round top ranked competitors in each fixture progress next round As rounds progress number competitors fixtures decreases final round usually known as final cup final consists just one fixture winner which overall champion In single elimination tournament only top ranked competitors in fixture progress in competitor games only winner progresses All other competitors are eliminated This ensures winner decided with minimum number fixtures However most competitors will be eliminated after relatively few matches single bad unlucky performance can nullify many preceding excellent ones double elimination tournament may be used in competitor games allow each competitor single loss without being eliminated from tournament All losers from main bracket enter losers bracket winner which plays off against main bracket s winner triple elimination tournament allows competitor lose two games creates third bracket fourth bracket are usually followed by playoff It usually used in curling tournaments Some elimination tournaments are in best series allowing competitor lose at most four times same competitor before being eliminated Some formats use repechage allowing losers play extra rounds before re entering main competition in later round Rowing regattas often have repechage rounds fastest loser from heats winners these progress but are at disadvantage in later rounds owing extra effort expended during repechage family tournament systems that grew from system devised Victorian Football League historic predecessor Australian Football League AFL allow teams with best record before playoffs lose game without being eliminated whereas lesser qualifiers are not Several most prominent leagues in Australia use such system such as AFL National Rugby League in rugby league League association football also used such system through its season but now uses pure knockout playoff Similar systems are used in cricket s Indian Premier League most curling tournaments were also used by Super League European rugby league before being scrapped after season In athletics meetings fastest losers may progress in running event held over several rounds e g qualifiers later round might be first from each heats plus fastest losers from among remaining runners An extreme form knockout tournament stepladder format strongest team individual depending on sport assured berth at final round while next strongest teams are given byes according strength seeds example in four team tournament fourth third seed figure in first round then winner goes semifinals against second seed while survivor faces first seed at final Four American sports organizations either currently use this format have in past Since mid s most ten pin bowling events use stepladder final usually involving five bowlers Two U S college conferences operate tournament format in basketball that combines two stepladder tournaments into one that both halves bracket are organized as stepladder tournaments eight teams are involved in tournament bottom four teams play in first round survivors will face seeds winners those matches take on top two seeds in semifinals This format was used by West Coast Conference WCC its men s women s tournaments from through has been used by Ohio Valley Conference OVC men since women from through From forward WCC tournaments will return aforementioned format but add an extra round so that all current conference members will participate note that OVC tournament does not involve all league s members currently In Philippines UAAP Basketball Championship NCAA Basketball Championship both use stepladder format if team wins all elimination round group stage games This format has been adopted other sports in both leagues other leagues If no team wins all elimination round games playoffs remain in usual two round playoff format now defunct Women s Professional Soccer used this format in all its three seasons existence an example its playoff system see Women s Professional Soccer Playoffs Group tournaments edit group tournament league division conference involves all competitors playing number fixtures again fixture one name tournament match that determines out two three more will advance fixture may consist one more game matches between competitors Points are awarded each fixture with competitors ranked based either on total number points average points per fixture Usually each competitor plays an equal number fixtures in which case rankings by total points by average points are equivalent English County Championship in cricket did not require an equal number matches prior In round robin tournament each competitor plays all others an equal number times once in single round robin tournament twice in double round robin tournament This often seen as producing most reliable rankings However large numbers competitors it may require an unfeasibly large number rounds Swiss system tournament attempts determine winner reliably based on smaller number fixtures Fixtures are scheduled one round at time competitor will play another has similar record in previous rounds tournament This allows top bottom competitors be determined with fewer rounds than round robin though middle rankings are unreliable may be other considerations besides reliability rankings In some professional team sports weaker teams are given an easier slate fixtures as form handicapping Sometimes schedules are weighted in favour local derbies other traditional rivalries example NFL teams play two games against each other three teams in division one game against half other twelve teams in conference one game against quarter sixteen teams in other conference American sports are also unusual in providing fixtures between competitors are ranking purposes in different groups Another systematic example this was Women s Rugby World Cup each teams in Group played each teams in Group B with groups ranked separately based on results Groups C D intertwined similarly An elaboration this system Mitchell movement in duplicate bridge discussed below North South pairs play East West pairs Main article Group tournament ranking system In competitor games ties are rare impossible competitors are typically ranked by number wins with ties counting half each competitors listings are usually ordered Wins Losses Ties ties are more common this may be points win tie which mathematically equivalent but avoids having many half points in listings These are usually ordered Wins Ties Losses If are more than two competitors per fixture points may be ordinal example first second third Multi stage tournaments edit Many tournaments are held in multiple stages with top teams in one stage progressing next American professional team sports have regular season group tournament acting as qualification post season playoffs single elimination tournament group stage also known as pool play pool stage round robin stage in multi stage tournament competitors are divided into multiple groups which play separate round robins in parallel Measured by points based ranking system top competitors in each group qualify next stage In most editions FIFA World Cup finals tournament first round has been group stage with groups four teams top two qualifying knockout stage played as single elimination tournament This format common in many international team events such as World Cups Olympic tournaments Some tournaments have two group stages example FIFA World Cup UEFA Champions League As well as fixed number qualifiers from each group some may be determined by comparing between different groups at FIFA World Cup UEFA Euro best four six third place sides qualified at Rugby World Cup best one five third place sides did so Sometimes results from an earlier phase are carried over into later phase In Cricket World Cup second stage known as Super Eight since before that Super Six features two teams from each four preliminary groups previously three teams from two preliminary groups do not replay teams they have already played but instead reuse original results in new league table Formerly in Swiss Football League teams played double round robin at which point they were split into top championship group bottom relegation group each played separate double round robin with results all matches counting ranking each group similar system also used by Scottish Premiership its historic predecessor Scottish Premier League since After games every club has played every other club three times division split into two halves Clubs play further matches against teams in half division This can often does result in team placed th having higher points total than team placed th final games are considerably easier nevertheless team in bottom half never receives higher final ranking than team which qualified top half multi stage pool system was implemented by Curling Canada Canadian championship curling tournaments Scotties Tournament Hearts women Tim Hortons Brier men starting in change was intended allow expansion main stage tournament from twelve sixteen teams while keeping round robin at eleven games teams are seeded using ranking system in which points are calculated based on teams results in all competitive bonspiels using complicated formula Seeds placed in Pool while seeds are placed in Pool B After each team has played seven games top four teams from each pool advance Championship Pool Carrying over entire round robin records with them Championship Pool teams play one game against each four teams in opposite pool with top four teams qualifying page playoffs In contrast teams that fail qualify Championship Pool play only one additional Placement Round game against team that finished in same position in opposite pool purposes determining final tournament ranking these teams little else play since no form relegation with expansion field sixteen teams no Pre Qualifying Tournament seeding based solely on performances participating teams not past results provinces territories they represent top Slovenian basketball league has unique system In its first phase league s clubs compete in full home away season with country s representative in Euroleague an elite pan European club competition exempt league then splits top seven teams are joined by Euroleague representative second home away season with no results carrying over from first phase These eight teams compete four spots in final playoff bottom five teams play own home away league but previous results do carry over These teams are competing avoid relegation with bottom team automatically relegated second from bottom team forced play mini league with second third place teams from second level place in top league Promotion relegation edit Main article Promotion relegation number competitors larger than tournament format permits may be multiple tournaments held in parallel with competitors assigned particular tournament based on ranking In Chess Scrabble many other individual games many tournaments over one more years contribute player s ranking However many team sports involve teams in only one major tournament per year In European sport including football this constitutes sole ranking following season top teams from each division league are promoted higher division while bottom teams from higher division are relegated lower one This promotion relegation occurs mainly in league tournaments but also features in Davis Cup Fed Cup tennis In Davis Cup first round losers in top level World Group compete in playoff ties against winners second round ties in Group competition s three regional zones with winners each playoff tie remaining in promoted World Group In three regional zones Group II conducted in knockout format winner knockout tournament promoted Group its zone first round losers then play relegation ties with losers relegated Group III Groups III IV in each zone are contested in round robin format top two teams in each group are promoted while bottom two teams are relegated assuming lower group in zone In Fed Cup four first round losers in World Group compete in playoff ties against four winners in World Group II with winners remaining in promoted World Group losers in World Group II play ties against four zonal Group winners two from Europe Africa one each from Asia Oceania Americas with winners playing in World Group II following season Groups II in all zones plus Group III in Europe Africa Zone only are conducted in round robin format bottom two teams in each group are relegated next group down assuming one exists while top two teams in Groups II III are promoted next higher group hierarchy divisions may be linear tree like as with English football league pyramid Bridge tournaments edit Main article Duplicate bridge In contract bridge tournament tournament in first sense above composed multiple events which are tournaments in second sense Some events
